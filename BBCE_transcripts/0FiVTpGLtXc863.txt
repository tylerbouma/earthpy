The team are going to examine
some strange goings-on
between the cats in Hanover Street...
to see if they can translate this language
and decipher what they're really up to.
Here's one cat they've been watching
for the last three weeks, Ozzy.
He was undisputed king
of his half of the street...
until Prince appeared on the scene.
Ozzy's losing his throne
and he's very grumpy about it.
It's a younger male, a grey cat,
who is a fighter.
His ear's notched in a few places
and he doesn't run away
when Ozzy shouts at him.
The scientists didn't know why
Prince was prepared to fight
for his right to roam
this particular street...
so they decided to put him
under surveillance.
They asked the other owners
what they knew.
He definitely lives on our street,
doesn't he?
He's on Hanover...
or he acts like he lives on our street.
If I leave the door open,
he'll try to break into my house
and eat Pussy-Cat's food off him.
They found Prince spent more time
on the street than almost any other cat.
I definitely recognise Prince.
He's been meowing at our door
to come in a few times.
Prince isn't just meowing.
Cat behaviour expert Dr Sarah Ellis
has spotted
some of the other ways
he's trying to communicate.
He spends a lot of time out on the street
and he's very, very confident.
You can see how he rushed over
to the person here filming.
And what he's doing here
is what we call a social roll,
so, it is a positive behaviour
and we know that because the cat is
exposing its stomach, its belly area,
and they wouldn't do that
if they felt very, very vulnerable,
if they were worried about that person,
because that's their most sensitive area.
And it isn't just an exposed tummy
on display.
Prince is also curling
the tip of his tail.
Generally if the cat
was in a really negative state,
the whole tail would be moving
and thrashing.
The end of the tail is often...
For example, when a cat is friendly,
the end of the tail will be curled round.
So, you'll often see
the soft tip of the tail.
Rumour has it that Prince's owner
has left him with flatmates while abroad.
So, is Prince trying to get noticed
and find someone else to take care of him?
He's been regularly coming round
for about three weeks now.
He's sweet and he's normally very vocal
and he's very bold.
He definitely wants to come in.
I feel like he's trying to sort of get
a second home.
He meows at the door and I think
he knows he's with a cat lover
when he comes down here.
Cats like Prince are doing
something remarkable.
They've learnt
how to communicate with people
and that meows and body language
are most likely to work.
And when they speak our language,
we can't help but love them.
Tilly is my aristocat.
She's long and elegant.
She's got a touch of Siamese about her
and a lovely narrow little face
and these lovely little ears.
They're tapping into something
deep rooted within us.
We love our cats because they love us.
They're everything to me.
She's like the last jigsaw of our family.
And she really makes our family
be together.
