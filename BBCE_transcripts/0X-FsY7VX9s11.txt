[Music]
when we think of wildlife rescue we
often think of the largest species that
can find themselves
in some sort of trouble however the uk
is home to a huge variety of creatures
not forgetting the smaller ones that
need the same amount of dedicated care
here at secret world wildlife rescue in
somerset
the dedicated team will rescue over 5
000
animals and birds each year this
includes foxes otters birds of prey and
badgers
most of which will be hand reared and
cared for prior to release
sometimes for as long as 18 months
but soon after we'd arrived we were told
they had some more unusual species
currently in their care
one being a juvenile swift
each year the team taken around a
hundred swifts
mostly juveniles that have fallen from
the nest
young swifts will be fed insect prey by
their mother
so the team here have to hand feed them
until they can be released
so dan tell us a little bit about what
you do here at secret world
so i'm a section leader here at secret
world so i oversee
a lot of the care of the animals that we
have in the wildlife casualty along with
the rest of the team
so making sure that they're looked after
and cleaned out and fed and have the
right medication
etc and also you know supervise other
members of the team in doing so
you have so many different species
coming in and
we've seen that well you've got swift at
the moment haven't you we have
yes we've got one swift left we've had
quite a few in this year
but yeah we've just got one left who
needs to get on his way really and get
back to africa
the most sort of challenging thing about
swift is they feed completely on the
wing
they fly around and catch insects in
their really large mouth and they've got
a very small beak as well so
actually in captivity they can't feed
themselves from a dish
or from a bowl like most of our
casualties can so actually we have to
hand feed swifts
through the whole time that they're here
so if we get a little hatchling come in
you know who's not long out of the egg
then that's quite a few weeks then of
actually
intensively hand feeding him wax worms
mealworms qrikets every few hours
to get them up to weight and ready for
release given their huge migration to
africa each year swifts face a multitude
of threats along the way
which has affected numbers but due to
ongoing development they have lost
insect prey as well as roosting sites
which is having a devastating effect on
the species
so tell us a bit about the process from
when you rescue a swift to
caring for it to eventually releasing it
so when a swift
um first comes in to us normally they
come in as juveniles often because
they've fallen out of the nest
so then we sort of assess them when they
come in to make sure that they're
not injured or i don't have any other
problems we then start the hand rearing
process which is
feeding every couple of hours we use wax
worms and mealworms and crickets to try
and give them a good balance of
insect-based diet
obviously we can't replicate exactly
what they have in the wild because
they'd normally
be fed on lots of different flying
insects but using those things with a
bit of
sort of mineral and vitamin supplement
as well that does just seems to do a
good job of rearing them
and then once they're up to a good
weight to about 40 and 50 grams
and their feather development is good
and they're sort of getting ready to go
they start to
refuse food and generally drop a little
bit of weight when they're getting ready
to go
and then we attempt the release so we'll
take them to a large open space we've
got some grass fields here so there's a
soft landing if they don't
don't successfully fledge and like a lot
of the other birds that we rear here we
can't
testify swifts in the navy or allow them
that sort of avery time because once
they fledge in the wild
they're in the air then for up to two
years can be before they'll come back
down to nest
so we do have to just give them the
opportunity to go and
once they're gone then they then they're
gone most the time it's successful
sometimes they need a few attempts
um to go but we basically just hold them
up in the air let the wind take get
under their wings and then take
themselves off
swifts only spend around three months
each summer here in the uk
and sadly with their numbers becoming
lower and lower
they need all the help they can get
whilst chatting with dan he told us they
had some more
rather unusual patients currently in
their care
so we went to take a look the uk
is home to 19 species of bat
and here the team rescue around 100 each
year
mostly juveniles that have run into some
sort of trouble
brown long-eared bats are strictly
nocturnal and will emerge from their
roost site about an
hour after sunset only flying in the
pitch dark
and despite being the second most common
bat species in the uk
seeing one close-up is incredibly rare
i can't believe how small she is she's
quite
yeah they are they're one of the smaller
species that we have they're they're
bigger than pippa straws
and our ears are fascinating aren't they
they are yeah i mean they use the ears
as
um to sort of hear insects and things in
flight and to when they're echolocating
to hear the
signals that come back to them so
they've got these large sort of
sensitive ears which are
really useful for them when they're
hunting weighing in at between 6 to 12
grams they are one of our smallest bat
species found in the uk
with their ears being nearly as big as
their bodies
they are easy to identify due to their
unmistakable ears which they use to find
prey and communicate through
echolocation
and when they sleep they tuck their ears
under their wings
looks like she's ready to she is going
to take off in a second she's going to
take you
there she is like
if she takes something she'll fly that
out
loss of insect prey as well as roosting
space has had a huge
negative effect on uk bat species
so getting the bats up to a healthy
weight is vital for their survival in
the wild
but dan also needs to make sure they
don't become
too overweight that evening dan took us
for a practice flight with some soprano
pipistrelles in their care
when the bats first arrive the team will
give them some good rest and food to get
their strength up before they test fly
but this is a vital part of their
rehabilitation
and assessment if they are flying well
with strong reactions they will be
released soon
but if not the team will keep them in
their care until they are ready
the bats have their test flights in a
special room with hanging towels
having obstacles in the bat's flight
path is highly important
as dan can assess the bats reactions
during flight
and also assess how well they are
echolocating
which is crucial for their survival in
the wild
but test flying bats can prove a bit of
a run around
this type of flight is exactly what dan
wants to see
and these soprano pipistrels are ready
to get back out into the wild on the
next clear night
a couple of days later the team gave us
a call as the young swift we'd seen a
few days prior
was ready to be released so we went
along
after spending the last few weeks being
hand-fed and cared for
he has put on enough weight and is
strong enough to face the big outside
world
sometimes they need a little
encouragement to get into the sky
but after a few seconds he finally makes
it
up into the air and thanks to the team
this young swift will hopefully one day
return back here to somerset
to the same nest site to sire his very
own
young swifts so that's it another swift
back
into the wild where he belongs and he
will spend the next two years of his
life
on the wing eating and sleeping
