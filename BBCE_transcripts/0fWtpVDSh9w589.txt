He needs to sedate the elephant,
so that the snare can be safely removed.
Guys, we are ready.
We go help the elephant.
This is good.
I'm happy now the vet's here.
Fred works alongside a spotter plane
to locate the injured bull.
He wants to dart it quickly
to stop it from suffering.
So, Fred's managed to fire the dart
and the elephant's taken off
through the trees,
so, we're just going to try and locate it.
Chopper's on the ground.
Oh, my goodness.
Jeez. That's really shocking.
On his side,
the bull's breathing is laboured.
We have to move fast to remove the snare.
Oh, they've got it.
The poachers have simply used
winch cable from a truck.
A snare like this is cheap to make.
It could've caught any of Wiva's family.
The reason that this animal has endured
this unimaginable pain is for this...
his tusks.
It just... it defies belief
how cruel people can be to animals
and how senseless this whole thing is,
that you can cause so much suffering,
so much pain, for an ornament.
Simply for an ornament.
This poor animal.
He's treated with a special clay
that'll help heal the wound.
What do you think, Fred?
Do you think it'll survive?
Ah, because the guy's body condition
is good...
he was walking
and also getting to another bad level,
but he's still okay to survive.
You see, the bone is not involved.
-Okay.
-The bone is intact.
Okay.
So, when the bone is intact,
the soft tissue can easily...
-Really repair.
-Recover, yeah.
Finally, the wound is treated
with an antibiotic spray.
All that remains is to wake him up.
Wow. Oh, my word.
Hey, fella.
Okay, move back.
Not taking any chances...
