Title: Snow Leopards: Ghosts in the Snow (Full Episode) | Part 3 | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zNm8-KNlqs


i'm dan o'neill
a biologist and filmmaker and i'm on a
mission to find out what it takes to
save
an endangered species
[Music]
join me on an expedition to the
mountains of kyrgyzstan
as i learn first hand how this country
has brought snow leopards
back from the brink
in this episode i discover why snow
leopards have earned the reputation of
being the phantom of the mountains
and i learned how camera traps and
skilled wildlife rangers have become the
eyes and ears of snow leopard
conservation
it's like a ghost of the mountains i
think it's the phantom
who's there but you never see it
good morning
oh that was an interesting night's sleep
i couldn't work out if i was cold or if
i was ill
i need i need a coffee and some
breakfast
and then we'll plan the day
look at that
such a stark habitat to live in so
they're living on the
side of everest the team make plans for
the expedition
and i'm introduced to the rangers many
of whom have spent their lives in these
mountains and for them
being in the reserve is just another day
at the office
um
it's amazing what these guys literally
have to go through every single time
they come here
the rangers and cooper you know they've
got millions of different jobs there
horse catchers horseshoers drivers um
wolf defenders camera trappers
anti-poachers
all in one and that's what's got us here
everything looks like a snow a bit
[Music]
trying to spot snow leopards against
this backdrop is way more challenging
than i could ever have imagined
it takes skill patience and dedication
and even then
the perfectly camouflaged cats often
elude the team
do you have any specific techniques you
use
yeah what's what are you yeah so first
we
scan this kind of ridges start with main
go scan and if you don't find you just
go this small ridges
okay so right now looking at this
mountain here
do you think there's a snow leopard on
it that is
so it is literally playing where's wally
except wally is so much easier to find
these mountains might look empty but are
home to a wonderfully diverse
range of species including snow leopard
prey like these argali
some of these creatures are targeted by
trophy hunters who will pay as much as
50
000 for a chance to shoot an argali or
an ibex
trophy hunting is banned within the
surrey chat reserve helping to safeguard
available food for snow leopards and
preserve biodiversity
but rangers are always on their guard
check out this
this is the remains
of a very big ibex
this is probably killed by a snow it's
pretty fresh
because you can really smell it oh god
oh
god this is so heavy
this is another casualty of the mountain
this is a male argali but i can't
believe they can carry
that much weight this was again probably
killed by a snow leopard
but even something this big way bigger
way stronger than a snow leopard
but they just have this amazing ability
and skill and dexterity when they're
hunting
look at that these are the same if not
very similar subspecies to marco polo
sheep
which is like one of the most uh
expensive animals to trophy hunt in the
world i think it could cost
between 30 and 50 000 to get a license
to hunt one
that's a big problem here this is a
reserve but
the whole surrounding area is concession
hunting concession for animals like
these
which in turn obviously damages the
population of snow leopards
but i don't think this was killed by a
hunter because of the one part he
probably would have taken
we're in the lair the snow leopard now
the rangers meet to plan how to deploy
the camera traps
the weather can change quickly and they
have a huge area to cover
there's a big debate happening right now
some of us are going to go
set cattle traps i think some people are
going to have to go
seven hours on horseback in that
direction and they've already
chatting about where to put the camera
traps
just sifting through hundreds of
pictures of snow leopards like this one
not good enough
this needs to be better we need to see
the size of the spots because
that's how they identify them all
coming from this side you can see on the
face and then
this right side you you can't you can't
see you know
so this one is fine
this one is fine this is fine
lessons learned and with the locations
decided for all 40 camera traps
it's time to saddle up and get to the
task at hand
for some of these rangers it's a seven
hour ride
we're gonna go and set a camera trap
over that mountain over there
and we're bringing our little friend
with us
to help carry the stuff
[Music]
[Applause]
so up here there's like a darker ridge
bit
and underneath it there's a massive
fallen rock um and cubans told us that
that rock is a very commonly visited um
place for one of the snow leopards here
as he's marking his territory as he goes
down the trails
and that is apparently a perfect place
um
to set a camera trap and i'm i'm a bit
intrigued
to know what it smells like but more
than that to be
exactly where a wild snow leopard has
just been
working at an altitude of over 4 000
meters is taking its toll
it's just a small hill
what the hell
you set the camera trap on that yeah
yeah
so it's not what came here this feels
very used this area here yeah yeah yeah
like something's late they come and they
have rest you know i mean these snoppers
like to sleep in the place like this you
know you know they like
this kind of hanging rocks you know so
it's not about count like this
yeah and then they do like this
you can do this and i will change the
angle of camera yeah yeah should i go
yeah no
just stay there and look at this camera
traps are motion activated
when something moves in front of the
lens the camera records a video
no no wait
[Music]
no no no yeah
right it was a bit better actually just
if you push it down
yeah look yeah just removing
all of the plants from the direct view
of the camera trap because if they set
them off
it's just gonna be thousands and
thousands of pictures of these weeds
that's gonna waste all of the power and
all of the space on the memory card
it's weird to think that where i'm
standing right now there's gonna be a
bunch of pictures of me creeping
and then maybe even a few days few weeks
there'll be a snow leopard following in
my footsteps
with the camera set and then spurred on
by rapidly dropping temperatures and
thoughts of a hot meal
we make our way back to camp
we have been scouring the tops of these
cliffs these ridges
for quite a long time now about four
hours
and nothing yet i'm still in good
spirits this is day one finding a needle
in a haystack
that mountain is hundreds of miles
thousands probably a mile squared
up there um and cuban is pretty sure
that there's probably
one two at least no leopards on that
cliff face right now
but it is one of the most camouflaged
creatures on the planet and as the light
gets
lower and lower it's harder and harder
to see them and either
they're most active dawn and dusk crew
muscular animals
so you have that real small window of
time
to get them
you're right mate i don't know how these
horses
do it completely naked look at him
running over
so you'll be surprised to know how many
people who are living in the mountains
where snow leopards are
they live smack in the middle of a snow
lipid habitat
they see the footprints of snow leopards
they hear the calls in the mating season
they see animals killed by snow leopards
but they've never seen a snorla in their
life
and that's what gives them this uh
mythical
mystical characteristic yeah so there
could be a snow leopard not
not even 50 meters from you but if you
don't know
what to look for you might very well
miss seeing it
i feel like finding a needle in a
haystack would be a walk in the park
compared to this
[Music]
what is that it's kind of strange
i can't tell what it is
[Music]
it's a snow leopard specimen
[Applause]
i know what it is
but vultures are a good sign they could
lead us to the site of a recent kill
every time these cameras record a snow
leopard it justifies the work that the
whole country is doing
those videos are the evidence that snow
leopard numbers are recovering
but we don't have long left in these
mountains we've got more camera traps to
set
and i hope beyond all hope that i
glimpse one for real
it's moving next time join me as i
venture deeper into the sarichat
mountains
the weather changes and reveals more
clues that lead me ever closer to seeing
and understanding
these rare cats
[Music]
