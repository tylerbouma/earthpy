Title: The Bowerbird's Grand Performance! | Life Story | BBC Earth

In Papua New Guinea,
the bowerbird has lovingly rebuilt
and redecorated his bower.
Another visitor.
This time, it's a female.
This is just where he wants her.
Time to begin the show.
First, he expands his pupils alternately.
It's an oddly mesmerising display.
A spot of limbering up
accompanied by a weird and wheezy call
from deep in his throat.
Now, it's time for his grand performance.
He waves his wing like a matador's cape.
She appears to be transfixed.
This is certainly eye-catching,
but it seems he needs to do more.
Generously, she drops him a hint.
It's the bird equivalent
of a bouquet of flowers.
It's all going so well
it's time to get physical,
with a few head-butts to her chest.
One final flourish to cap weeks of effort.
But something's wrong.
His rival is back
and at the worst possible moment.
What should he do?
For the female, the moment has gone.
Sometimes, whatever you do,
things just don't work out.
