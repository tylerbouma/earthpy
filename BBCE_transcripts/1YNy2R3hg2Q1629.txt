triggered by the reins and all-devouring
army locusts
millions emerge from eggs buried in the
sand gathering into columns which may
stretch for ten kilometers
at this stage they can't fly only hop
but it doesn't hinder their progress
these sweeping hordes devastate any
fresh growth in their path
after five weeks of steady munching the
infantry becomes airborne
these breeding swarms can cover up to 80
kilometres a day but only while the food
and moisture lasts
so how do you define a desert in Africa
they're places where less than 50
centimeters of rain falls a year
