I think you might want to back up
a little bit there.
As opportunists, these lizards
will try and eat anything
they think they can get away with,
even, occasionally, people.
It seems that pickings around
the guides' huts must be pretty good,
'cause there are loads of dragons here
and they're big!
So, these are Komodo dragons.
The largest lizards on Earth.
And just extraordinarily broad, powerful.
Okay, big fella, it's all right.
It's okay.
Don't want to move quickly,
because that could trigger
a predatory response.
Much safer just staying calm and still.
It looks like he's trying
to regurgitate something.
Seeing the dragons on the islands
of Komodo might not be hard,
but they're so efficient that they can go
a very long time without hunting.
So, it could be tricky to see them
at their deadly best.
I do have a few ideas though.
There's one bit of science I'd really like
to try with the Komodo dragons here.
This is a bite test gauge.
It measures the force
of the bite of an animal.
So, if I bite on this here...
it should register...
about 120 pounds per square inch.
To get the dragons to bite, we're going
to need a little bit of encouragement
in the form of some honking meat.
We have a bite test gauge
with stinking rotten meat on it.
Let's see what damage
our Komodo dragons can do.
Lizards aren't generally known
for the force of their bite.
So, I'd like to find out what
this super-sized specimen can do.
Is it going to actually bite down, though?
Okay, that felt like more of a bite.
With the smell of blood in the air,
I'm suddenly surrounded
by ravenous, drooling jaws.
Okay, guys. It's all right.
We'll let it take it.
Back off. Back off. That's fine.
So, they're just chomping away at it now.
Hopefully...
wow... they'll get the meat off there
and I'll be able to recover
the bite test gauge
and see what we registered.
So, you can really see how that tail
can be used as a defensive weapon.
It's like it's been hit by a baseball bat.
Just going to wait a couple of minutes
before I go in and get my gauge back.
With the meat gone,
I carefully go in to see how much power
the dragons are packing.
Whoa!
Well, that is much more
than I was expecting.
We've got
nearly 600 pounds per square inch,
which is five times a human bite force
and much more
than I'd expect from a monitor lizard.
I mean, these animals
have really light-weight skulls.
They actually rely far more on
their very sharp, backwards-facing teeth
to deliver a killing bite
than they do the force of their bite.
So, to have a bite that strong
is incredible.
