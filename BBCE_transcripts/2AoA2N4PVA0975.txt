Let's go.
Okay, on him.
-Is everyone all right?
-Got a handfull here! Need a hand!
A little assistance.
-Okay, open it.
-Okay.
On with the show, people. Come on.
There's no time to lick their wounds.
The team must deliver the rhino
to their new home.
These rhinos are going to go to a farm,
which is probably about
200 kilometres away, but it is dirt road,
so, it's going to take us about three,
three and a half hours to get there.
On game, especially rhino, we'll escort
the animals all the way to the farm.
I think it's really important for rhino.
They're special animals.
The partition separating mom and calf
in the truck
is opened so they can run out together.
-Wait.
-Come here!
Open the truck door!
But Mum's an angry rhino
and she takes it out on her calf.
Above the cries of the calf, Shaun
and Emma do all they can to get Mum out.
Good girl. Good girl.
-Oh.
-Horrible female.
Yeah.
Really was a horrible girl.
-Have you ever seen that before?
-Never ever.
Never seen that.
