[Music]
golf grunion
scout the beach
[Applause]
then in their hundreds females surf in
on the waves
shadowed by eager males they are here to
spawn
but it's not going to be easy
each female tries to propel herself as
high up the beach as she can
to lay just beyond the reach of the
waves
[Music]
drilling herself into the sand is the
cue for the male grunian to move in
they wrap themselves around her jostling
to fertilize the eggs
[Music]
in the frenzy many eggs are dislodged
once flicked out of the sand they won't
survive
[Music]
although these fish out of water might
seem
vulnerable the mass of flickering bodies
confuses predators
[Music]
the greatest danger comes as they
wriggle back to sea
this is the moment the pelicans have
been waiting for
slightly deeper water means they can get
their bills
underneath to scoop out their victims
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
this female runs the gauntlet and makes
it through
her rags will develop quickly in the
warm desert sand and be ready to hatch
in two weeks
from the next spring tide
a mud skipper a fish that spends most of
its life
out of the sea
it can walk on land and breathe air
its life is very different from that of
most fish
a fish out of water maybe
but they thrive here in japan
so what's made this upheaval worthwhile
the answer lies in the mud
as the tide retreats it exposes mud
flats
sunlight hits the rich silt and tiny
plants and animals flourish there
all food for a mudskipper
but life on land is not without problems
it's hard work to find a mate
[Music]
jumping high above the mud will get you
[Music]
noticed
[Music]
with eyes perched on the top of their
heads the mudskippers keep a lookout for
both
friend and foe
and males fight those who intrude on
their territory
[Applause]
they must also take care not to dry out
in the sun
rolling in the ooze keeps the skin cool
and moist
for this smaller species a better option
is to retreat underground
so he digs himself a tunnel down into
the mud
[Music]
[Music]
his heap of spoil is an indication of
the extent of his excavations
with the tide flooding the tunnel twice
a day
maintenance is a real burden
northern australia has the highest tides
in the tropics
which expose vast areas of shoreline
and here lives a truly extraordinary
species
of octopus
[Music]
octopuses are marine animals they live
and breathe underwater
at low tide most octopuses will be
imprisoned
in their rocky pools
[Music]
but this is no ordinary octopus
[Music]
it's the only one specially adapted to
walk
on land
[Music]
it pulls itself along using the hundreds
of tiny suckers
that line its arms
[Music]
hunting for crabs it walks from pool
[Music]
apart from a rather startled fish
this one is empty
so the octopus moves on
[Music]
a rock pool may seem like a safe refuge
but the octopuses suckers enable it to
move
just as stealthily in water as out of it
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
nowhere is safe when this octopus
is around
the savage rocky shores of christmas
island
200 miles south of java in the indian
ocean
it's november the moon is in its third
quarter
and the sun is just sitting and in a few
hours from now
on this very shore a thousand million
lives
will be launched
these crabs are all females and of a
kind that occurs only on christmas
island
as darkness falls more and more of them
appear
clambering resolutely down to the sea
now it's nearing midnight their numbers
can only be guessed at but on the island
as a whole there are probably 120
million
of these crabs and nearly all the adult
females among them
have chosen this time for their annual
spawning
a crab like this is carrying about a
hundred thousand
eggs and she has to shed them directly
into the sea
if they are to hatch but that's a
hazardous business for her
because although her far distant
ancestors came from the sea
she herself is a land crab and she can't
swim
so if a wave sweeps her away she will
assure her to drown
but nonetheless her compulsion to launch
the next generation is
irresistible and when at length she does
reach the sea
her triumph is apparently ecstatic
the crabs have picked the moment when
the tide is at its highest
so that they have the shortest distance
to travel across the beach
to reach the water the astronomical
numbers of their eggs
turn the clear ocean water into a black
turbid soup
as dawn approaches and the tide recedes
so the eggs are swept out to sea
it's high tide and huge shoals of mullet
are feeding in the shallows
traveling at speeds of up to 30
kilometers per hour
they drive the mullet onto the beach
trapped the fish have nowhere to turn
flattening out their bodies like
surfboards they skim in just inches of
water
the surf mums are the only dolphins in
the world that hydroplane and beach like
this
[Music]
it looks fun but this is a high-risk
game
they could easily strand but with a few
effortless wiggles
they're back in the water
[Music]
