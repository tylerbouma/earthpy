Back in the nursery,
Min Min's baby is fighting fit.
She's now ready to go back to mum.
Not as straightforward as it sounds.
Min Min may not have had time to bond
with her baby,
and it will be covered
in different smells,
so there's a risk she might have nothing
to do with her daughter.
The team hold the baby
in front of Min Min,
expecting her to come forward...
...but she shows little interest.
This is not a good sign.
After all that she has gone through,
there is a real possibility
that Min Min will now reject her baby.
The keepers move the baby closer.
The youngster cries out desperately
for mum to pick her up...
...but she still ignores
the helpless baby.
The keepers step in.
Making Min Min more comfortable,
they try again.
Then something clicks.
To everyone's relief,
Min Min's maternal instincts
finally kick in
and she gently accepts the baby.
Things are at last looking up
for the reunited family.
