Title: Sand Snake vs Lizard | Wild Africa | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bdimtt60Pw


in this barren sea of sand it's harder
for larger animals to find enough to eat
you've got to be a real specialist like
the Namib sand snake by sidewinding it
can swim its way up the dunes but in
such an open arena ambush is tricky it's
speed that counts the wedge snouted
lizard can afford to be blase it has a
secret weapon
rocket propulsion
then it's under the sand as fast as you
can the best place to escape predators
and the Sun
