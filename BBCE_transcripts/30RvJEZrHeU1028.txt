Incredibly, in spite of the din
and confusion,
returning birds are able to find
their nest and partners
without any difficulty.
And the reunion is always marked
with a jubilant display.
The parents will now swap duties.
The one just arrived
will feed the chicks and guard them,
while the other,
having fasted for a couple of days,
will go down to the sea to feed
and collect more food for the young.
Those that are nesting
on the lower slopes are lucky.
Others have to climb so high
that their nests are up in the clouds
for much of the time.
The trek down from the nest
can take another hour,
but it has to be done
if the chick is to be fed.
When at last they reach the sea,
their journey that, so far,
has been merely arduous
becomes very dangerous indeed.
A leopard-seal.
A single leopard-seal may catch
up to six penguins an hour.
During the season, it will kill hundreds.
A wounded bird, having escaped
almost miraculously from the seal,
must now face the merciless skuas.
In spite of its injury, it still struggles
upwards towards its nest.
