But first impressions can be deceptive.
This isn't the parent.
This is a Skorpiovenator, a predator.
The skeleton found at the nest site
was almost certainly a nest raider,
preying on the hatchlings.
The hatchlings' real parent
and the owner of the enormous vertebra
is Argentinosaurus...
a plant-eating giant
that dwarfs everything around it.
From the bones that were found,
we've calculated that Argentinosaurus
was a colossal 35 metres long,
and weighed as much as 75 tons.
When born, the hatchlings themselves
weigh a paltry five kilograms...
and need to fend for themselves
immediately.
From studying the embryos
and looking at the bones of the adults,
we know that the growth
of these giants was phenomenal.
Over 40 years,
they grow from five kilograms
to an astonishing 75,000 kilograms.
At their peak, it's been calculated
they grow up to 40 kilograms every day.
The dinosaur embryos are so well preserved
we can see they already have their teeth,
in preparation for a lifetime of eating.
But becoming a giant takes more than
simply turning tons of food into muscle.
It's about the success and survival
of a species over millions of years.
One way to increase
the chances of survival
is by having lots of offspring.
And the best way to do that
is by laying eggs.
Lots of them.
The nest site in Patagonia
stretches for an astonishing 15 kilometres
and contains tens of thousands of eggs.
And the site was used continuously
for hundreds of thousands of years.
