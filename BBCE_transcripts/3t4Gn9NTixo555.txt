San Martin's fly from South Africa just
a nest in the banks of this river in
Hungary they are here for the abundant
insect life but as their chicks grow
demand outstripped supply but in their
time of need
the river provides a perfect banquet one
by one they emerge
[Music]
the army flies
[Music]
their moment of glory lasts just three
hours just time enough to mate and lay
eggs they are a super food for the
hungry chicks
[Music]
[Music]
as the day ends the mayflies perform
their swan song
[Music]
the Sand Martins are so full they lose
their edge and appetite but their loss
is another's gain
you
you
