Title: The Dark Side of Shoebill Chicks | Africa | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ArjlPAU_X4


A giant, prehistoric-looking bird.
A shoebill.
Standing well over a metre tall...
she roams these swamps...
trying to catch catfish.
Not exactly what she was after.
Deeper into the swamp
lies the reason for all this fishing.
This chick is just three weeks old
and a little bit wobbly on its feet.
Its vast bill
means it has trouble balancing.
It won't be able to fly,
or even walk properly, for several weeks.
It's entirely reliant
on its parents for food and water.
There is also a smaller chick,
who isn't doing so well.
The larger chick pesters its mother
for a drink.
While she goes off to fetch water...
it reveals a dark side to the relationship
with its nest mate.
It's three days older than the other chick
and has always won the race
for food and attention.
This is more than just a scrap
between two siblings.
As their mother returns,
she sees what the larger chick has done.
The smaller chick
seeks its mother's comfort.
But she has already made her choice.
Only her first-born will get a drink.
