Title: Predator X hunts in deep water | Planet Dinosaur | BBC

This animal
is in the worst possible place,
hunting alone at the surface, where it's
most vulnerable to attack from below.
In deep water,
Predator X can use its full power.
Although, injured and stunned,
this plesiosaur
is armed with a vicious bite.
So, Predator X still needs to be wary.
Severely wounded, now the only sanctuary
is the shallow water of the nursery.
Predator X's bite is formidable,
estimated to be four times that of T-rex.
Biting hard, it perforates the body,
cutting through muscle and bone
before shaking it to pieces.
It's almost certain that the bite marks
on the fossil plesiosaur
were made in this way.
And the position
of the marks also indicated
the attack came from below.
