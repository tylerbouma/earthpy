Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TWqIW3tpnI


like elephants hyrax live a long time
for up to 15 years four times longer
than most small mammals it's hard to
survive in the big wide world alone
without the protection of the colony
klipspringer antelope are not a threat
but the old archenemy is never far away
and out here away from the copies that
aren't many places to hide
exposed on a baking rock plane even
hyrax get thirsty there may be unknown
dangers
you
