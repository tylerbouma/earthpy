Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kizCCIhtUs


we share
our planet with spectacular wild animals
which have adapted to live in the
strangest
and harshest of environments
now more than ever they are an
inspiration
for us all
[Music]
and in these extraordinary times there
is one thing
that can offer solace to everyone
the wonder of the natural world
[Music]
to raise our spirits during the pandemic
we brought together composer han zimmer
and jacob shea and
top selling artist dave
to create a visual and musical feast
from the hottest deserts
[Music]
to the freezing poles
and from highest mountains
to mysterious kingdoms underwater
[Music]
this is planet earth a celebration
[Music]
never before in the history of humankind
has it been more critical to protect and
nurture
the natural world
which is after all our home
too
you
