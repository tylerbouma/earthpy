Diana places a one-way mirror inside
the observation window
to test the dolphins.
Now, we're looking through a window
and they'll be seeing a mirror.
Dolphins don't behave like this,
staying in one place and staring,
if they simply meet another dolphin.
This suggests they understand
that what they're seeing
isn't another animal
but a reflection of themselves.
One action never normally seen
is this curious fin wiggling.
It's an example of what scientists
call self-directed behaviour.
Things the dolphins only do
when they're looking at the mirror.
Other self-directed behaviors
included looking inside their mouths
and twisting to see their belly.
They are using the mirror like a tool
to look at parts of their own bodies
they usually can't see.
This looks nothing like what they do
when they're socially interacting
with another.
They perform all sorts of odd behaviors
much like we might do
in front of the mirror,
to see what we look like
when we do that new dance step
or when we just want to see
how we look in a new in a new outfit
or what we look like
when we do a certain behaviour.
so it's striking to see these.
