There is no other species on the planet
that responds
as quickly and as dramatically
to the good times as the desert locust.
Eggs that have remained in the ground
for 20 years begin to hatch.
The young locusts are known as hoppers,
for at this stage they're flightless.
They find new feeding grounds
by following the smell of sprouting grass.
Normally it takes four weeks
for hoppers to become adults,
but when the conditions are right, as now,
their development switches
to the fast track.
As the vegetation in one place
begins to run out,
the winged adults release pheromones,
scent messages,
which tell others in the group
that they must move on.
And when groups merge, they form a swarm.
An adult locust eats
its entire body weight every day
and a whole swarm can consume
literally hundreds of tons of vegetation.
They have to keep on moving.
The swarm travels with the wind.
It's the most energy-saving way of flying.
Following the flow of wind
means that they're always heading
toward areas of low pressure,
places where wind meets rain
and vegetation starts to grow.
As they fly,
swarms join up with other swarms
to form gigantic plagues
several billion strong
and as much as 40 miles wide.
They will consume every edible thing
that lies in their path.
This is one
of planet Earth's greatest spectacles.
It's rarely seen on this scale
and it won't last long.
Once the food has gone, the steady roar
of a billion beating locust wings
will once again be replaced by nothing
more than the sound of the desert wind.
