One creature is determined
not to miss his chance.
Patagonia's male wandering tarantulas
are searching for love.
This male's spent four years
reaching maturity.
But in two months, he'll be dead.
He's in a serious hurry.
He'll barely eat or sleep.
This is what he's looking for.
Silken threads left by a female.
Impregnated with her pheromones...
chemical love letters,
advertising her availability.
They lead him to her lair.
She can live for 30 years.
She's seen many suitors in the past.
He taps a seductive rhythm
to tempt her out.
She replies.
For him, this is a very dangerous liaison.
He eyes her up.
If he's not her type, she'll eat him.
But this male has a talent for seduction.
He tenderly stokes her body.
She relaxes, opening her fangs...
allowing him to move closer.
He carefully delivers his packet of sperm.
During mating,
the female falls into a trance-like state.
She stays like this for several minutes.
He has to make a quick getaway
before it wears off.
For tarantulas,
lingering goodbyes are generally fatal.
