Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsXgLgj-xI


I'm about to try
and do something,
that I've always dreamt of,
but never thought would
be possible.
Leviate.
I want to know if I
can defy gravity,
using the power of science.
Mastering levitation could
transform our world.
Benefiting everything from
the environment we live in,
to medicine.
This technology could
change your life.
And as someone who
loves science,
It feels like I'm 
looking at magic.

I want to know how 
close we are.
Tah-dah!
So I got in touch with 
YouTube creators,
across the world.
What's that?
Liquid nitrogen 
superconductor.
And together...
Oh!
We're gonna try and find 
the cutting-edge,
science and technology.
I'm super curious to
know how all this works.
This is cool!
That will tell us,
if it's possible
to beat gravity.
Take that, Earth!
All right,
I'm gonna do it!
