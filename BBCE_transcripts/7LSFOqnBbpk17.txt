the honeybee
is the only swarm we have ever
domesticated but we are still
unraveling the mysteries of much of
their behavior for those who understand
the swarm's inner mind
it's possible to control them in a way
that is quite extraordinary
[Music]
the bees are being summoned by a secret
signal
one that causes them to act with a
single mind
swarms are made from thousands of
organisms but they work
by acting as one
[Music]
by understanding the swarm's secret
language it's possible to make them do
the most extraordinary things
[Music]
so
[Music]
one hundred thousand bees cover his body
creating a living suit
he has such control over the bees he
rarely suffers a single sting
he is a professor of entomology and has
been studying bees in their
communication
all his life
by covering his body with a pheromone
that the queen bee uses to control her
hive
he has them at his command they react by
protecting him with their bodies
to them he is the queen bee
using science he has learnt to control
what most of us dread
and the result is quite disturbing
as he brings a swarm into our world
people are forced to confront their
fears
[Music]
they also see that with knowledge such
an incredible force of nature can be
controlled
when swarms invade we are inevitably
separated by an invisible barrier
created by our different senses and
perceptions
[Music]
swarms may share our world but the gulf
between us
couldn't be greater
to control the swarm we need to
understand how they
see the world
but swarms not only experience things
differently from us
they think in a different way too
[Music]
