I'm kind of shaking half with excitement
and half with a little bit of trepidation.
There, Johnny.
Wow.
Our first sight,
but they're all around us.
Up there, the silverback.
And there's a little baby, an infant,
just hanging on this branch here, look.
Let's move up this way.
It feels quite vulnerable to be so close,
knowing that if he wanted to charge
he'd be on me in a heartbeat.
It may seem insane to be thinking about
putting an animal that's so gentle,
so careful and a vegetarian
on to the Deadly 60,
until you get a good look at this guy.
This is the silverback, the dominant male,
And I have to say...
there are very few more impressive animals
in the whole world.
He is absolutely massive...
despite the fact that
he probably is no taller than I am.
He would be at least two times my weight
and way more muscular.
Just walking across now.
You can see that silver saddleback
as he goes
and just the strength
to just brush bushes aside.
Look at that incredible bulk.
They are majestic animals.
A hundred and sixty kilos of silverback
gorilla just vanish into the undergrowth.
This is the absolute typical habitat
that you'll find gorillas in,
very, very thick, very, very dense.
They spend a great deal of time
feeding on just about everything we can
see around us now.
So, they're actually
surprisingly difficult to spot,
even though they are very large animals,
but this is a good-sized group.
Christopher, how many animals
do you think are in this group?
-There are twelve individuals.
-Twelve individuals.
Four silverbacks, three adult females,
two blackbacks,
one juvenile and two infants.
-Right.
-Yeah.
We try and keep a respectful distance
so we don't disturb the gorillas
as they feed.
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.
But suddenly a cheeky confident young male
moves menacingly towards us.
This is the blackback.
He's the young male.
And they can be...
more of a worry than the silverback
'cause they have more to prove.
You see how easily he just pulled
that tree down to cover himself.
People that actually work with gorillas
a lot reckon
they're probably ten times stronger
than people.
I've seen them bend iron bars.
He's looking at me at the moment,
sussing me out.
But he knows he's far bigger and stronger
than me and I pose no threat to the group.
The guides make me stand my ground
as he comes in for a closer look.
Right, well, that is a blackback gorilla
letting us know who's boss.
