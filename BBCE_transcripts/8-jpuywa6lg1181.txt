With feathers that allow it
to blend in with the forest,
Sinornithosaurus can move unseen
through the tree tops.
And Sinornithosaurus is a hunter
with a potent secret weapon.
In 2011, a study of the eyes
of this creature revealed
that it was a predator perfectly capable
of hunting equally during day and night.
And a study of its teeth, in 2009,
showed something
that definitely sets it apart from birds,
something far more deadly.
The greatest danger
is not simply being outnumbered.
We have found that Sinornithosaurus teeth
have unusual and distinctive grooves
along their length.
They resembled those
of the venomous Gila monster,
the grooves in its teeth
used to deliver venom into its victim.
The team even identified
what they thought was the location
of the venom sac in the fossil.
It appeared Sinornithosaurus
could kill with poison.
This is a far more deadly predator
than anyone ever imagined...
