Title: The Intense 8 Hour Hunt | Attenborough Life of Mammals | BBC Earth

They hunt in silence.
The hand-sign indicates that one of them
has found the track of a group of kudu.
These are the San people
of the Kalahari Desert,
the last tribe on Earth
to use what some believe
is the most ancient hunting technique
of all, the persistence hunt.
They run down their prey.
They start to feel the rhythm
of the animals' movements
from the spacing of tracks.
The group is not moving fast.
The animals have taken fright.
They will concentrate on the bull.
He will be carrying a heavy set of horns
and therefore will tire more quickly.
To do that,
they must separate him from the herd,
so his tracks won't be confused
by those of others.
The sun is overhead and the men sense
a change in the kudu's pace.
He's slowing.
After hours of tracking,
they've entered an almost
trance-like state of concentration.
At times, it's impossible
to see any sign of the kudu's tracks
and the hunters must imagine
the path it will have taken.
The heat is hard on the hunters,
but they're now close enough
for the next stage in the hunt...
the chase.
This is the signal for it to begin.
But only one man will undertake it,
Karohe the runner.
He must be relentless.
It's now a test of endurance.
Who will collapse first,
the man or the animal?
This was how men hunted before they had
weapons, when a hunter had nothing more
than his own physical endurance
with which to gain his prize.
Running on two feet is more efficient
over long distances than running on four.
A man sweats from glands
all over his body and so cools himself.
A kudu sweats much less and has
to find shade if it's to cool down.
And a man has hands
with which to carry water,
so during the chase he can replenish
the liquid he loses as sweat.
Hours pass and Karohe is getting closer.
But then the kudu runs into thick cover.
The tracks have disappeared.
Karohe tries to puts himself
into the mind of the kudu
and himself re-enacts the moment
when it heard him approaching
as it tried to rest in the shade.
He deduces the direction
in which it must have fled.
It's close by.
The chase has lasted eight hours.
Hunter and hunted are both
at the end of their strength.
Neither can go on much longer.
And then the kudu collapses...
from sheer exhaustion.
It's close to death.
Karohe's spear-throw now
is scarcely more than a symbolic gesture.
The hunter pays tribute
to his quarry's courage and strength
with ceremonial gestures that ensure
that its spirit returns
to the desert sands from which it came.
While it was alive,
he lived and breathed with it
and felt its every movement
in his own body.
And at the moment of death,
he shared its pain.
He rubs its saliva into his own legs
to relieve
the agony of his burning muscles.
And he gives thanks
for the life he has taken,
so that he may sustain
the lives of his family,
waiting for him in their settlement.
