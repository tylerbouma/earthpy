I'm about to try and do
something,
that I've always
dreamt of,
but never thought
would be possible.
Levitate.
[Music]
Personal question, but have
you ever levitated?
No, not levitated.
We're looking for raised up,
off the ground,
without moving parts,
without mechanical support.
Can we do it? I
don't know really.
Gonna find out now 
aren't we?
It feels like I'm
looking at magic.
So, I've got a little 
practical experiment,
liquid nitrogen 
superconductor.
Right, are we ready?
So how can we make magnetic
levitation on a large scale?
Genuine levitation.
Despite what you might think,
gravity is actually the
weakest of the 
fundamental forces.
We can have pretty much
levitating everything.
Welcome to the future.
That is so cool!
I mean, I think if we
try to levitate you by sound,
we'd need a massive speaker.
All right. Bit rude.
[ Laughing ]
