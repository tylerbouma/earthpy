northern elephant seals these hardened
travelers of the high seas come here
from icy Alaskan waters
this old male is the beachmaster he
defendants a harem of females here to
give birth on this raised sandy beach
[Music]
for the beachmaster it's an opportunity
to mate he'll fight anyone who dares
come close to his harem with a colossal
two and a half tonnes behind him what he
lacks in looks he makes up for in brawn
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the beachmaster wastes no time in making
the most of his victory he'll have to
fight battle after battle to continue to
hold the fort
