some new faces are appearing at the
entrance otter cubs spend the first two
months of their lives hidden inside the
den these are now emerging for the first

their regular show strength may deter
the large caiman from showing too much
interest in the babies in giant otter
society it's only the dominant female in
this case pinky who produces a litter
and with almost ceremonial style each

baby's confidence in the water but with
the new responsibilities the family
becomes even more digital
