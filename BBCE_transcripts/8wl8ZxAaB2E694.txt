Wolves.
These, in northern Canada are the largest
and most powerful in the world
and they are setting out to hunt.
The pack is 25 strong,
a sign that the prey
they are seeking is formidable.
These bison are even bigger
than their southern cousins
and the largest land animals
in North America.
For generations, wolves and bison here
have been shaped by their battles
with each other,
making each the most impressive
of its kind.
The bison will not stay long
among the trees.
They're not safe here.
The wolves are closing in,
but their chance of ambushing
the bison in the woods has passed.
Their prey are now in the open
and grouped together for safety.
The wolves will need to work as a team
if they are to make a kill.
They circle the herd,
trying to unsettle it and split it up.
But the bison are armed and dangerous.
They will be safe
as long as they stick together.
The wolves up their game,
harrying the herd,
a ploy to trigger a stampede
and split away one of the smaller ones.
The bison form a defensive circle around
their young, horns pointing outwards.
The wolves need a bison to break rank.
But the tables are turning
and now the wolves have to retreat.
The pack focus their attention
on the rear of the herd
and the bison begin to panic.
A young bison falls behind.
Even this yearling dwarfs the wolves.
Running head-down,
the herd's only thought is escape.
A stroke of luck for the wolves.
The kill will feed the pack
for several days.
But then they will have
to resume the chase.
At the frozen ends of our planet,
the struggle for survival never eases.
