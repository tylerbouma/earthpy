October in the far south female Weddell
seals haul out on the sea ice to give
birth imagine the shock of leaving a
womb at plus 37 degrees centigrade and
being dropped on the ice into a world at
minus 20
the pup has to suckle and build a layer
of blubber as fast as possible it
usually manages to double its weight in
10 days for Weddell milk is 60% fat one
of the richest produced by any mammal
remarkably after one week the pup is
ready for a swim
