With higher water,
the mother bear has moved to the falls,
where the salmon are most active.
But the big male has taken over
the best fishing spot.
She needs to keep herself safe
but she also needs access to salmon.
She cautiously moves closer
to the big male.
She's probably still a little unsure
of him after their last encounter.
There's lots of salmon
swimming through the falls now,
but with the big male so close by,
she can't really move around
as freely as she needs to.
The big male has control
of the best fishing site,
but due to the closeness
of the mother bear,
he also seems to be losing some
of his focus.
Then he manages to grab another salmon.
However, this one is a male
and he lets it go.
The mother bear is less fussy right now,
but she's unable to take advantage
of the opportunity.
Neither bear is very happy
with the presence of the other.
The mother bear decides to move in
and take advantage of the scraps
the big guy has left behind.
The big male seems annoyed
by her presence so close behind him.
Something has to give.
At this rate, neither bear
is going to be successful.
The mother is getting more confident,
growling at the big male,
letting him know she wants him
out of there.
Finally she builds up the nerve
to storm his position.
Even though she's much smaller than him
she's not backing down.
She wants access to the salmon
more than he does.
The big male tries to intimidate her
with his much larger size.
But she holds her nerve refusing to leave.
Finally the big male has had enough
and moves on to other fishing grounds.
Now the mother bear
has the falls all to herself.
This has been a hard won salmon,
but I think there's going to be lots more
where this came from now.
