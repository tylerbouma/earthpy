Title: Lions Hunting Donkeys | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ip4AKdKiZA


Donkeys have been bred to be docile,
and they have no instinct
of how to escape.
No animal has a concept of restraint,
predators least of all.
These last 45 minutes could be
their undoing,
and it puts Flip
in a really awkward position.
He doesn't want the cubs killed
but keeps to his promise
to inform the village.
These two young lions are
very important to to your conservancy.
But if these lions kill
any of your livestock,
you know you can shoot
them if they cause problems.
And it is not for me to say or ask
for you not to shoot them.
That's your decision.
And all I'm saying to you is
before people shoot them,
if they kill livestock,
you've got to think very carefully.
Those two lions were born here,
they are used to this area,
and that's very valuable
