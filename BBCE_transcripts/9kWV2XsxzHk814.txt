Sea snakes.
At one time, these snakes' ancestors
lived on dry land.
They must still visit the surface
to breathe.
But they are beautifully adapted
to life at sea...
hunting for fish around the island reefs.
They have some of the most toxic venom
of any animal,
so, they don't have many predators.
But as they forage off the coast
of one small island...
their greatest nemesis is approaching.
Yoko and Setsuko are hunters
and they have a fearsome reputation.
These two 70-year-olds
are on a shopping trip like no other.
Yoko and Setsuko
live on the tiny island of Kudaka.
It's only four kilometres across
and, with limited space on land,
the locals look to the sea to provide.
As the sun sets,
the ladies' prey is approaching.
On certain summer nights,
venomous sea snakes
move towards the island
and gather in coastal caves...
looking for shelter
and fresh water to drink.
But coming ashore on this island,
is extremely risky.
It takes some nerve to wade in
with no protective clothing.
Sea snake venom can be ten times
more powerful than a rattlesnake's.
Yoko has been hunting snakes for 40 years.
It's a skill that's been passed
down the generations here,
for at least five centuries.
