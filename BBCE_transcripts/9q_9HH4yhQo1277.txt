We first met Noddy enjoying the peace
and quiet of the nursery.
But he was getting too big and boisterous.
It was time for him to move on.
Every morning, around 200 rescued
orangutans are led into the forest
for their day at forest school.
Here, under the watchful eye
of the babysitters,
they can learn all about
their natural surroundings.
Wild orangutans can stay
with their mothers for eight years
before they're confident enough
to make it on their own.
But every one of these forest school
orangutans is an orphan.
It makes the long and difficult road
to becoming an independent orangutan
so much harder.
No wonder Noddy looked a bit overwhelmed.
Hey, Noddy.
What is all this?
This is a big tree root, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
This is a big guy, yeah.
You never seen them this big before,
have you?
It was amazing to see how quickly
Noddy adapted to life in forest school.
But he wasn't quite ready for this.
Runa, one of the largest orangutans
in forest school,
was playing truant from her own group.
With so many orangutans in the forest,
it's hard for the babysitters
to keep track of them all the time.
She was easily three times Noddy's size,
and can be too rough
with these little ones.
Luckily, Runa was a only after
a juicy papaya.
But seeing this giant on his first day
really knocked Noddy's confidence.
There was still so much for Noddy
to learn.
Rehabilitating all these orphans
is a real challenge.
It'll be five years in forest school
before Noddy is anywhere near ready
to face the world as a wild orangutan.
It had been a good first day,
but Noddy looked exhausted.
