life is going quite fast so it's very
important to do something that you love
and don't do something that you have to
do when I am on my horse I think about
people who are working in the city and
they don't have the luck that we have my

[Music]
you can say that the gajin is the cowboy

this region into this weather and to
this type of life or the Guardian the
horse is the most important collect my
horses name is empirical it's very great
to have a horse who can help you like
this one
there are bulls and cows who have breed
for camel grazing but it's very
different from carita there is no death
of the bull inside the arena and it's a
game between some young boys you have to
catch some tag on the horn of the booth

maybe during winter when it's quite cold
and you can have strong winds more than
100 km/h then you have to start early in
the morning to go and feed everybody
because the Bulls and the horses they
don't have any weekend then any free day
