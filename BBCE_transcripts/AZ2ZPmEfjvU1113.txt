Her eyes and ears that were closed
for the first two weeks of her life
are now opening,
and with this comes
a whole new world of sensory stimulation.
She uses her vision to move around,
but does she see the world
the same way we do?
Well, dogs are colour-blind,
but that doesn't mean that everything
is black and white.
She does see colour,
but mostly just blues and yellows.
It's because she only has two types
of colour receptors
compared to humans who have three.
It's also why your dog will often ignore
an orange toy in the green grass,
as those colours look the same to them.
Better to give them something blue.
But it's when things are moving
that her vision comes into its own.
Dog's eyes process what they see
more quickly than we do.
It's almost like they see in slow motion.
That's why they're always
in the right place to catch the frisbee.
A dog's hearing is also superhuman.
They can hear things
four times further away
and twice as high-pitched as we can.
It's why we can't hear dog whistles,
but it also means they can hear the hum
of lights
and even the pulsing sound
of a quartz crystal in a digital clock.
But there's one sense
she'll use more than any other:
her sense of smell.
A dog's brain is
one-tenth the size of ours,
but the part that controls smell
is 40 times larger.
They have up to 300 million scent glands
in their nose
compared to our five million
