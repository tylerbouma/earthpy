Title: Teaching Cheetah Cubs to Play & Hunt | Cheetahs | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak7fgTNgFGY


but like all young cheetah cubs they
were really nervous of any new
experience that's just what you'd expect
with wild cheetahs they have to be
certain but this is safe and the only
way they know that is if their mother
demonstrates that it's something they
can tackle so I'm going to keep on
touching it and playing with it myself
it's okay it's okay
Oh
good hunting lesson number one pretty
successful
