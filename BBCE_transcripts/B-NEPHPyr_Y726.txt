Reunited at last.
The mother sees her chick
for the first time.
She's keen to start parenting...
but the father needs persuading
to surrender the chick
he's been caring for all winter.
He must now put his chick at risk.
In these temperatures,
it could freeze in seconds.
The male will have to let go.
Eventually, the transfer to the mother
is safely made.
The chicks grow quickly
on a diet of fish and squid.
Soon they are keen to explore,
but always with mother in tow.
This chick is less fortunate,
its mother has not returned to claim it.
Another orphan
is searching for a new family,
but this female
already has a chick of her own.
Some orphans receive too much mothering
from penguins
whose own chicks have not survived.
The urge to parent is so strong
that they will compete with one another
to adopt any chick they find.
Many of these squabbles end in tragedy,
as the poor chick is trampled to death.
Those chicks that do have parents
quickly learn survival skills.
Even in spring,
they must huddle together for warmth,
just as their fathers did
in the depths of winter.
A group of chicks has
got lost in the blizzard.
Cold and disorientated,
they search for the colony.
It will not be long
before the storm claims its first victims.
By early summer, the chicks
are surprisingly well-developed...
and now look ready to take on the world.
Those that survive their first year
have the best possible start in life,
thanks to the extraordinary hardships
endured by their parents...
parents who battled with
the Antarctic winter and won.
