The father leads one team.
The mother intercepts a panicking elk.
They all share the spoils.
But all is not quite as collaborative
as it seems.
This pack strategy works well
for the alpha couple
but not quite so well
for last year's offspring.
The youngsters could have their own pups,
but for the alpha couple,
that would mean more mouths to feed
and less for their litter.
So, the alpha couple
will actively discourage
last year's offspring from mating.
But one of their daughters
has other ideas.
Skulking behind the pack
is a lone male wolf.
He has no territory of his own
but follows the family
scavenging leftovers
and looking for opportunities.
He has spotted one.
The young daughter.
The intruder could be in with a chance
as long as he's not caught.
The pack leader could kill him.
While the pack is distracted by a bison,
the temptation for the young female
is too great,
and she sneaks away
to join the mysterious stranger.
It's risky, but it could be
her only chance to get close
to a potential mate.
When mating, wolves lock together,
unable to separate for half an hour,
to ensure fertilisation.
Not so good if you're about to be caught
by your dad.
The affair was always destined
to be a short one.
After a painful separation, her new mate
is chased away with his tail
between his legs.
