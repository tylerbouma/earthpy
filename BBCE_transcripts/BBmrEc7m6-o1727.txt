as heralds of the flood the sacred Ibis
that now populate the river are held in
high esteem as they probe for snails
they resemble scribes dipping pens into
ink so are also credited with the power
of knowledge but in reality they are
important for a more practical reason
evidence from autopsies on mummies has
shown that Egyptians suffered from
bilharzia a liver parasite carried by
water snails as the Ibis eat the snails
they make pools safe for the villagers
to bathe
