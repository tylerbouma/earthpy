Ying Hua, a three-month-old female.
Abandoned by her mother
after only a few days,
she is being hand-reared.
Pandas have twins 50% of the time
but choose only to keep the strongest.
It's nature's survival of the fittest.
Ying Hua wasn't chosen by her mum,
so the nannies go out of their way
to spoil her rotten.
She has already outgrown her incubator
and is piling on the pounds.
Puppy fat on a baby panda is good.
At 11 pounds,
Ying Hua is filling out well.
You need to know your panda
is growing properly,
so everything is weighed and measured.
They're robust at this age,
and a little bang is all part of the fun.
When baby mammals are hand-reared,
you have to do everything that mum does,
and that includes encouraging them to wee
and poop.
In the wild,
they can't do this on their own,
so mum helps by licking their behind.
Tapping Ling Hwa's back end is
the next best option
and simulates what panda mums do
with their tongue
to encourage going to the toilet.
This will need to be done on each panda
multiple times a day.
Pretty much after every feed.
So when you count them all up,
that's a lot of toilet training.
