a mouthful of fish
[Laughter]

is free to go to sea to feed for itself
[Music]
aware of the leopard seals presence the
penguins pressed together at the ice
edge unwilling to be the first to risk
diving in
[Music]
occasionally the seal comes out onto the
ice and attempts to grab one
[Applause]
[Music]
but it's most successful strategy by far
is the lion wait
[Music]
it hides behind the corner of ice
the antlers gain confidence and make a
dash for it
[Applause]
[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

the remaining penguins make a break for
the open sea
[Applause]
[Music]

Antarctic autumn is nearly 10 these
adults will walk across the newly formed
ice to endure yet another winter on the
frozen sea
