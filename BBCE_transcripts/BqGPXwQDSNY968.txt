The smaller females travel as a group,
keeping a watchful eye in all directions.
They know that killers lurk in the depths.
The surface is a dangerous place
to linger, especially is you are alone.
Orca, killer whales.
The sea lion is wounded
but the killers keep their distance.
His powerful jaws are still a threat
to the hungry orca.
He struggles towards the safety of land.
But his injuries are slowing him down.
Blow by blow, they wear him down.
It's a carefully coordinated attack.
One killer distracts his attention
while another hits his soft underside.
The richest seas on Earth
can be treacherous.
