Title: Tiger Hunts Lone Baby Deer | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv4d5XHVgGg


Living alongside Tigers
for as long as I have
means you notice the smallest detail.
I have a theory
that when a tiger licks its paws,
it's preparing to hunt.
This could be a good sign.
It has been many days now
but I still haven't seen Bhagani
make a kill.
With no tigers to hunt them Sariska's
deer herds have increased in size...
But bigger herds mean more eyes
to watch out for hunting tigers
and that makes them more difficult
to catch.
Yet another problem for Bhagani.
I'm desperate to see her catch something,
so I can be sure
she's getting enough to eat.
These are young deer
and they've never seen a tiger.
They might be easier to catch.
She is perfectly placed.
Has she got one?
Yes, at last I know for sure
she is feeding.
It's only a small meal
but it gives me great confidence
for the future of Bhagani and Rajul.
