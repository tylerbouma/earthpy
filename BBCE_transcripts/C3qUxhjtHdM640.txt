Title: Young Lions Kill Donkeys | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3qUxhjtHdM


The youngsters have found their way back.
Unlike their mother,
they haven't had time to work out
how to steer clear of people
and livestock.
And this time they're exploring upriver
towards Purros.
Just five miles from the village,
they head into big trouble.
Donkeys have been bred to be docile
and they have no instinct
of how to escape.
No animal has a concept of restraint,
predators least of all.
These last 45 minutes
could be their undoing
and it puts Philip
in a really awkward position.
He doesn't want the Cubs killed,
but keeps to his promise
to inform the village.
These two young lions are very important
to your conservancy,
but if these lions
kill any of your livestock
you know you can shoot them
if they cause problems.
And it is not for me to say or ask
for you not to shoot them.
That's your decision
and all I'm saying to you,
is before people shoot them
if they kill livestock,
you've got to think very carefully.
Those two lions were born here,
they are used to this area
and that's very valuable
The lions have a lucky break.
Since the donkey's were living wild,
the community decides to be lenient
this time.
