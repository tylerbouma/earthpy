Malekith island is the nesting ground
for some 60,000 Cape gannets normally
one gamete parent goes off fishing while
the other looks after the chick but
declining fish stocks means both parents
are often away hunting at the same time
leaving their chicks unguarded something
which hasn't gone unnoticed by the
pelicans

only chicks with parents at their side
