but at the far end of the continent down
among the highlands of South Africa
wildlife has been blessed with a much
more stable past
the cape highlands are Africa's oldest
mountains built out of the most solid
rock 380 million years ago long before
the Africa we know was even born
for tens of millions of years the
climate here has remained steady ruled
by the oceans and their currents
year-on-year cold winters follow dry
summers
