Title: Mapusaurus gang Vs. Argentinosaurus | Planet Dinosaur | BBC Earth

On its own, even it is not a match
for a fully-grown Argentinosaurus.
But this giant killer is not alone.
For years, it was thought
that an adult Argentinosaurus would be
too big for any predator to tackle.
But in 2006, a new discovery
suddenly made even the biggest
of dinosaurs a lot more vulnerable.
As they dug into the Argentinean dirt,
they didn't just find
one predator buried here.
The skeletons of at least
seven Mapusaurus of different ages
and sizes were found together.
It suggested that this was a group...
a giant killer
that appears to hunt in gangs.
And more than capable
of taking on the very biggest dinosaurs.
Not even a fully grown Argentinosaurus
is safe from this group.
The best defence is their sheer size.
Mapusaurus's teeth are perfectly designed,
like blades, to slice off chunks of flesh.
With prey so large,
a single bite isn't always fatal.
It appears Mapusaurus could just snack...
feeding from its victim
without actually killing it.
The victim surviving to provide
more food at a later date.
But even in a group, these giant killers
are never far away from danger.
Attacking an animal more than ten times
your weight carries grave risks.
