The Mara River marks the edge
of the Ridge Pride's territory.
Right now, it looks peaceful enough,
but believe me, it can be a deathtrap.
I can't remember the last time
I saw something like this.
Lions hardly ever attack crocodiles,
but normally they give each other
a wide berth.
With these lions,
almost anything can happen.
The message is
"Don't mess with the Ridge Pride."
