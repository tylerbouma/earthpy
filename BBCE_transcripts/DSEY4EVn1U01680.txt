the Dassin Island couple are now getting
on with courting meaning noisy foreplay
and fancy footwork
for first time is it can be a tricky
business and it doesn't help to have
someone looking over your shoulder
the boulders / herds conduct their love
lives in front of a human audience but
this doesn't seem to cramp their style
the Penguins ardour doesn't always cool
off when the Sun Goes Down and noisy
neighbors can mean sleepless nights
Oh
going to put penguins living next door
to penguins isn't always fun games
you
