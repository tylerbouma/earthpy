Title: Ground Squirrels Tease a Poisonous Cobra | Wild Africa | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZp_nX3g9Ec


ground squirrels have ready-made
parasols under the shadow of their
fluffy tails they can resume foraging
while the Sun is still high in the sky
but the trouble with being active at
this time of day is that so are
cold-blooded animals like the Cape Cobra
ground squirrels have such quick
reflexes they're in no real danger but
they're still anxious to be rid of it
they now use their bushy tails to
intimidate and frustrate the snake
rather like a red rag to a bull
it's all too much for the Cobra better
to just slip away quietly
