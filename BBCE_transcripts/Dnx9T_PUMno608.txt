Life is also about to change
for the Kung Fu clan.
Before Klinky led the group out to forage,
there's a problem to be dealt with.
Her family are on edge.
Even partner Ningaloo
stays out of the way.
Pregnant Klinky is on the warpath.
Klinky spots her daughter Mrs McGee.
She has decided that her days
in the group are numbered.
Mrs McGee is about to be banished.
She tries to protect herself
by being submissive to her mother.
It's not going to help.
Klinky bites her viciously.
Mrs McGee is not wanted.
Klinky is merciless.
Two more daughters get the same treatment.
Klinky is banishing into exile
any daughters who are
or could become pregnant.
But then she spots something.
Bebe, the weakest of these daughters,
is trying not to be noticed.
She almost gets away with it.
Klinky wants to make sure the group
raises just one set of offspring...
her own.
They're all fighting
for limited resources.
Any competition would put
Klinky's pups under threat.
She won't let that happen.
Klinky has driven four of her daughters
out of her family.
They watch forlornly from a safe distance.
Life for them in exile
is going to be tough.
However brutal this seems,
Klinky is prepared to go much further
to protect her unborn pups,
if she needs to.
