At the goose colony, it's high summer
and eggs are hatching.
The young all emerge within a day or two,
a marvel of timing.
The colony is now home
to a million goslings.
The fox is still gathering
all she can get.
Sometimes one mouth simply isn't enough.
One will have to do.
Not all food is stored.
Some is needed right now.
She has seven hungry cubs to feed.
As their appetites grow, the mother
must work tirelessly to raise her family.
Only fat healthy cubs
will survive the Arctic winter.
The vast majority of the goslings
are still flourishing.
Their parents lead them down
to the safety of the water
as soon as they're strong
enough to make the journey.
For the foxes,
boon time has come to an end...
but the mother has given her cubs
the best possible start in life.
The geese will continue grazing
the tundra until the summer ends
and they're forced to head south
for the winter.
