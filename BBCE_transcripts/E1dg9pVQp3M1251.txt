Title: Killer Whales vs Sea Lions | Attenborough: Trials of Life | BBC Earth

For sea lions to venture into deep water
here is very dangerous indeed.
It's much safer to stay in the shallows,
if they can.
In one or two places, channels enable
the whales to get close to the beach.
Those are the danger spots.
To get off the beach,
the killer has to thrash its body.
No other whale deliberately beaches itself
in this way
or has perfected this method
of getting back to the sea.
As long as the sea lions stay well up
the beach,
you might think they would be safe,
but the hungry whales are very daring.
Now several of the whales are hunting in
a group.
That's sea lion was keeping just ahead of
one of the whales
but was caught by another
it probably hadn't seen.
It's a savage beating,
maybe to separate hide from flesh.
