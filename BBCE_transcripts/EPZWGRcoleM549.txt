Title: Turkeys Play with Deer and Squirrels | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPZWGRcoleM


and I had never considered that the Wild
Turkey was a playful bird but in fact
they are playful they are curious about
things that don't benefit their survival
directly the white-tailed deer is found
late this year and as always turkey boys
vying for some reaction but this time
he's bitten off more than he can chew
[Music]
the young deer can give as good as she
gets
[Music]
sweet peas favorite is far more amiable
the fox squirrel seems to want to play
as much as she does
[Music]
there's no question in my mind that
these birds experience joy in their
lives
[Music]
it was learning new things about turkeys
every day but this was not just about
how they lived their life these animals
were showing me how to live my life also
