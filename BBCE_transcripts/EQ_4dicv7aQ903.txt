Title: Putting the Cub's Teeth to the Test | Tigers About the House | BBC Earth

Well, Spot here is usually cool,
calm and collected.
Even though he's naughty, too, and
he likes to be just as naughty as Stripe.
But he's a bit more mellow
and he's the one that probably gets
beaten up by his brother more so.
Stripe's usually the one
to do the naughtier things first.
But Spot took an opportunity while Stripe
was sleeping to beat him in something.
Will you stop biting me?
The cubs are now using anything and anyone
to try out their new teeth.
So, Giles has a plan.
So, this morning we're going to see
if they want to use those carnassial teeth
that they've just got.
Carnassial teeth are specialist molars
that allow carnivores
to slice meat efficiently.
The fact that they've got
those big chewing teeth at the back,
the ones that slice the meat,
is a good indication to me
that they're probably at the point where
they can start to chew their own food.
So, if these guys were in the wild,
Mum would definitely be taking them
to where she's made a kill
and probably giving it a go themselves.
It's a really, really big step,
because if they take well to this,
this morning,
then, you know,
we can move on to other stuff.
This new phase often triggers
the development
of another specific tiger behaviour.
They might get a little bit possessive,
if they really get into it.
If they really like it you might see
a little bit of swiping and snarling.
And being more food focused
than his brother...
Boys.
...Giles wants first-born Spot
to give it a go.
You're just the one I wanted.
Mm! What's this?
What is it? Are you ready? Yeah?
Yeah?
Oh! Excuse me! That's my hand! No.
He got possessive straightaway,
but he's using his teeth.
He's got the idea.
To the side. There we go.
If I just let it go,
he'd keep swallowing it.
So, the fact that I pull it to the side
makes him use his carnassial teeth,
which are the ones that are designed
for chewing off chunks of flesh.
Dearie me. Just...
I'd leave him alone for a second.
Turned into a tiger.
No! Ah-ah-ah... Ah-ah-ah...
Good boy. It's all gone. All gone!
And it's not long
till Stripe has his turn.
This is Stripe
and Stripe normally isn't as driven
for his food as what Spot is anyway.
But he's doing a good job.
If it was the other way round,
with Spot eating the piece of meat,
he wouldn't tolerate
Stripe jumping all over him like this.
He'd be all possessive.
So, Spot's more driven for the food.
Stripe's giving it a go.
Easy!
Being possessive is completely natural.
If they've made a kill in the wild,
then they're going to do
all they can to keep it.
They've spent a lot of energy
making that kill.
And if they don't eat,
then they don't survive,
so it's worth investing
the energy in being...
Right on the inside thigh.
It's worth the energy...
invest in trying to protect it.
Spot is the more affectionate one.
Stripe is the naughtier one.
But when it comes to food, as you can see,
this little guy's definitely
much more driven.
Therefore it makes him
a little bit more possessive.
With the cubs getting stronger
and feistier,
their days being able to live with
Giles and his family are numbered.
