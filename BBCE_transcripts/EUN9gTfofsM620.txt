Title: Viper Bite in Slow Mo! | BBC Earth

More than 65 percent of India's population
lives without indoor sanitation.
Heading into the night barefoot
to answer the call of nature
is the norm in rural areas
and one of the most common causes
of snake encounters.
Using the figures from the new report,
and his own decades of field experience,
Rom estimates that the Russell's viper
could be responsible
for half of all fatalities.
Many occur in circumstances
just like this.
Okay, let's have the main light on. Okay.
It's such accidental interactions
between people and snakes
that are at the heart of the problem
and Rom has devised an experiment
to analyse exactly what's going on.
What we're doing here is replicating
what could be a very common occurrence.
Someone walking around at night
accidentally steps on the snake,
in this case a Russell's Viper,
and gets nailed.
But what's really special about this
is we've got a high-speed camera,
which can shoot up to five thousand frames
per second,
showing a snake bite like no one
has ever seen it before.
To make things as realistic as possible
we've got this artificial leg,
which is actually very light,
much much lighter than a real human leg.
So, although it looks pretty invasive
we're not really hurting the snake
but we are definitely threatening him
with a human leg.
What we've got here is a series of images
of snake striking.
You know, some of us who have had
experience with these creatures
feel that we know what they're doing,
but it took this kind of a reveal,
doing this kind of high-speed photography,
slowing down the motion,
to see exactly what's going on,
the mechanics of a snake bite.
My impression is that
when you step on a viper
he reacts immediately
by giving you a good strong tough bite
But what we actually found
was that the majority of times
that our artificial foot actually
comes in contact with a viper,
the snake just wants to get away.
In fact, sometimes so dramatically,
it sort of half leaps through the air
and gets away.
