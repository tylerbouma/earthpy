Title: Smart Dolphins Beach their Prey | The Hunt | BBC Earth

Hunting is only possible
for three hours around low tide,
when the mud banks are exposed.
Razor-sharp oysters
cover much of the shore.
Beaching here could be lethal.
The hunters need to find a stretch
of shoreline with just the right slope.
Too level and the dolphins risk stranding.
Too steep and they can't force
their prey from the water.
Working as a team, the dolphins surround
the fish, driving them towards the shore.
Attacking in perfect synchrony,
the dolphins create a bow wave.
It carries their prey
on to the muddy banks.
Other fish-eaters profit
from their daring.
Herons and gulls follow every hunt.
To get to the fish first, the dolphins
drive themselves high up the bank.
But if they go too far,
they risk stranding.
To prevent fish escaping between them,
the dolphins all beach themselves
on the same side.
Always the right.
But this has a cost.
Each time they grab a fish,
they also take in a mouthful of mud.
The grit gradually wears down their teeth.
But on one side only.
In time, these teeth get so worn down
that older dolphins
can no longer hunt like this
and must find other ways to catch fish.
