After 17 years underground,
creatures are stirring.
The nymphs of the periodical cicada
have been biding their time.
Now they march like zombies towards
the nearest tree and start to climb.
At first there are merely thousands,
but soon more than a billion
swarm all over the forest.
The biggest insect emergence
on the planet is underway.
They invade the upper branches where
they climb out of their external skeletons
and assume their adult winged form.
At first, they're white and soft.
But they have until dawn
to complete their transformation.
After an absence of 17 years,
the forest is now overrun by cicadas.
The adults are clumsy and very edible.
For turtles and other inhabitants
of the forest,
this is a feast they're lucky
to see once in their lifetime
and they gorge themselves while they can.
Times have never been so good.
The cicadas have no defences
and virtually offer themselves
to their attackers.
The stream of insects is so relentless
that soon all the predators
are full to the point of bursting.
And still the cicadas come.
With the predators overwhelmed,
the survivors can achieve their purpose.
After mating, the adults lay their eggs
and then their job is done.
In just a few days they will all die
and the forest will fall silent.
The cicadas here will not be heard again
for another 17 years.
