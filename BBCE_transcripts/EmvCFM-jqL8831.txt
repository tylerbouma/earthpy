newspaper it's used for smoking the raw
powerful tobacco that every village

a day for a couple of sheets or so but
these people normally use dried leaves
as cigarette wrapping and had no idea
what to do with the paper they took it
rather as though it was some sort of
useless memento this plain there was not
a success so Laurie tried salt instead
this was much better received and what
