Title: Young Penguin's Narrow Escape and First Swim | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2ethtmiFyQ


The rockhopper chick is still stuck.
Despite his caution, he ends up
taking the biggest tumble of all.
But his troubles aren't over yet.
A caracara, a dangerous predator.
Another joins.
At the worst possible moment,
he's completely outnumbered.
But then... backup arrives!
Steamer ducks...
the most aggressive in the world.
They hate caracaras and won't give up
until every one is gone.
The chick's not about to hang around.
This time, he has some company
for his final farewell.
He takes the plunge,
sliding down the rocks
like it's a water shoot.
But it's not over yet.
The giant petrel is back,
predatory to the last.
The chick dives...
but immediately pops right up again.
He's never been underwater before.
This time, the petrel has him!
Others close in for the kill.
But the petrel loses his grip.
This time, the penguin
stays safely under for good...
and joins the others in the sea.
He will never look back.
This is where he is meant to be.
He'll spend the next three years
learning the secrets of the sea...
before he returns here to breed.
He's now in his element...
and gone in a flash.
