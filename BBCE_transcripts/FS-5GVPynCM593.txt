Seeking to assert himself perhaps,
the young male lays claim to the carcass.
There are still plenty of leftovers.
His mother seems to be content
to watch him feed...
just so long as he keeps
the family's dinner safely stashed.
Trees ought to provide secure
storage for hard-won spoils...
a place beyond the reach of hyenas...
and other thieves.
It's a juvenile blunder...
and his timing could hardly be worse.
African wild dogs
are formidable pack hunters...
capable of killing adult leopards,
as well as cubs.
The cats need to move fast.
Right now
he is not his mother's favourite.
Yet for both cubs
this has been a useful lesson.
To stay alive, you must stay alert.
The pack soon gives up and moves on.
