[Music]
off the coast of south africa
more adolescents have reached that
difficult age
at two years old male bottlenose
dolphins leave their mother's pod
to form boisterous gangs looking for
excitement
they like nothing better than surfing
spy turtle is here to see what they get
up to
[Applause]
he in turn is joined by another spy
creature
this is spy puffer based on a fish that
blows itself into a defensive puffball
the spy creatures are here to film these
teenage tearaways
spy puffer faces a bumpy ride
bus stops are common
it's easy to get caught in the middle
young males are so unruly the females
kick them out of the family pod
[Music]
this isn't spy puffer it's a real
pufferfish
the poor creature gets the same rough
treatment
for a game of catch
[Applause]
but the dolphins are dicing with death
are one of the most poisonous fish in
the ocean
they exude a powerful nerve poison
called tetrodotoxin
it only takes a small amount to kill a
human
even so the dolphins often look for
puffer fish
and love to chew on them
taken in small doses the secretions seem
to have a narcotic
effect
[Music]
the dolphins are careful not to swallow
them instead they
hold them gently in their mouths
despite the risks passing the puffer has
become a popular dolphin pastime
[Music]
[Music]
luckily the little fishes usually
survive the strange experience
[Music]
in western australia these dolphins have
taken on
an even tougher challenge the fish
have taken refuge close to the beach
where the water is only a few
centimetres deep
tail slapping is a method dolphins often
use
to stun their prey but it doesn't seem
to work here
the fish are tantalizingly close
but they're still out of reach so the
dolphins
try another technique
vigorously pumping their tails they work
up some speed
and then they hydroplane
[Music]
[Music]
their momentum carries them right
through the shallowest waters
and onto the fish
now they're in real danger of being
stranded
but fortune favors the brave
[Music]
younger dolphins lie alongside watching
but so far only eight individuals here
have mastered this daring technique
[Music]
the predators ignore each other there's
only one victim here
the millions of tasty little fish
they've been stalking
for so long
[Music]
young gannets joined the frenzy in just
six months they've become
superb aerial hunters
[Music]
time after time the dolphins round up
another shoal for destruction
frantically the little fish tried to get
away from the seething surface of the
water
to dive beyond the range of the gannets
now something truly astonishing happens
diving takes the gannets down to 10
meters
then the aerial squadrons become shoals
of swimmers
as they pursue the fish down to 20
[Music]
meters
sardines joined with the predators in a
beautiful yet macabre
underwater valley there's little chance
of escape
for these fish
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the stage is set for the biggest
predator
of all
the brood as whale takes in ten thousand
fish
in one giant mouthful
but this time around there are plenty of
sardines for all
hunting is only possible for three hours
around low tide
when the mud banks are exposed
razor sharp oysters cover much of the
shore
beaching here could be lethal
[Music]
the hunters need to find a stretch of
shoreline with just the right
slope
to level and the dolphins risk stranding
too steep and they can't force their
prey from the water
working as a team the dolphins surround
the fish
driving them towards the shore
attacking in perfect synchrony the
dolphins create a bow
wave
[Music]
it carries their prey onto the muddy
banks
[Music]
other fish eaters profit from their
daring
herons and gulls follow every hunt
[Applause]
to get to the fish first the dolphins
drive themselves high up the bank
but if they go too far they risk the
[Music]
stranding
[Music]
to prevent fish escaping between them
the dolphins all beats themselves
on the same side
always the right
but this has a cost each time they grab
a fish
they also take in a mouthful of mud
the grit gradually wears down their
teeth
but on one side only
in time these teeth get so worn down
that older dolphins can no longer hunt
like this
and must find other ways to catch fish
the beaches family have a new arrival
[Music]
puck's precious eighth calf is a boy
named sammy
[Music]
no more than a few hours old the baby
instinctively shadows his mom's every
move
[Music]
samu calls continuously to her as if to
say i'm here i'm here
[Music]
[Applause]
in the first hours of samo's life he is
on a huge learning curve less than a
meter long
sammy when swimming
bobbing up and down samu's movements are
jerky
and uncoordinated
this tiny dorsal fin is still floppy
from being squashed up inside mum
puck doesn't let her baby out of her
sight for a second
[Music]
until now parker's chosen to be alone
with samu
perhaps giving him time to adjust to his
new world
[Music]
then something remarkable happens as the
rest of the beachy's family start to
arrive
as if to celebrate puck's daughters and
grandchildren are gathering to welcome
the youngster into this close-knit
family
whether she called them in will never be
known but at last the rest of the
beaches family
meet little samuel
with her family around her puck can
afford to relax
knowing their safety in numbers
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
