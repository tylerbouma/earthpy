green turtles are regular customers here
a turtle shell is fused from its ribcage
and covered in living skin she can feel
the tickling on her shell to encourage
the service a turtle adopts a special
posture
on a reef as anywhere there are those
who will abuse the hospitality
manta rays come to be clean by wrasse
and surgeonfish
Sergent fish are spawning and the milky
blue clouds are their eggs
surgeonfish breed with the cycles of the
moon the mantas can shed all their
cleaning appointments to make sure
there's a meal afterwards
