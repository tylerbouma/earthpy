Sun the sun's just started to come out
that put a stick in the in the trunk
just to keep the trunk patent so he can
breathe properly it's very reassuring to
hear the noise now we need a collar with
the bull snoring contentedly the
colouring team move in getting the GPS
collar on is the priority
it's not often a wild bull elephant lets
you get this close so the team are
taking a range of scientific data the
information gathered will help to
protect the desert elephants because the
elephant's down they might as well just
take as many samples as possible it's
getting hot so they need to work quickly
just enough time to let baby Phoebe meet

the car idling just in case it gets a
bit quicker than we anticipate and takes
