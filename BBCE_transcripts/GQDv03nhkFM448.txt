13.8 billion years ago the universe and
time as we know it began within a few
hundred thousand years the cosmos would
be ablaze with stars
hundreds of billions in our galaxy alone
on the scale of galaxies and stars the
planets in our solar system are little
more than grains of sand caught
momentarily in the light of the Sun
[Music]
but it's on these motes of dust that for
four billion years great stories that
played out and seen over the last two
decades spacecraft have ventured to
every planet in our solar system
revealing the lives of the eight
planetary siblings as never before
[Music]
