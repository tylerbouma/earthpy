Capuchins have different calls
for different threats.
The rest of the troop
instantly recognise this one...
and all come together.
They try to scare the snake away
by making as much noise as possible.
Even the baby is determined to help.
But his mother has spotted something.
This yellow rat snake isn't after monkeys.
It's after a Brazilian rodent
called a punaré.
Capuchins are incredibly curious...
and even the baby can't resist
taking a closer look.
But there's a fine line
between curiosity...
and foolhardiness.
With hundreds of backward facing teeth,
there's no way the snake
is giving up his prize.
But that wasn't the only punaré.
All fear forgotten,
the little baby scrambles to join in.
But punarés aren't easy to catch.
Once again, it's the experienced male
who takes the lead.
The group finally get a decent meal.
Just as importantly,
our baby monkey has passed his first test
in surviving on his own.
He's also witnessed just how resourceful
his family needs to be to survive here.
