One family here can't wait
for winter to really arrive.
These polar bears need the sea
to freeze completely,
so they have a solid platform
from which to hunt seals.
Right now, they're hungry.
The cubs' mother can sniff out
a meal from 20 miles away.
The rotting remains of a bowhead whale.
It may not look too appetising,
but this blubber is packed
with calories and vitamins.
An adult bear can eat 60 kilos
at a single sitting.
The problem with a feast like this
is that it will bring in hungry bears
from miles around.
They might not be a threat...
but she's not going
to hang around to find out.
Soon the sea will be frozen solid
and the bears will be back
in their element.
