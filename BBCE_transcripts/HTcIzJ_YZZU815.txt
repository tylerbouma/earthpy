Title: Honey-Trapping Bears | Wild Japan | BBC Earth

Mr Nakayama has been keeping honeybees
for more than 65 years.
And these sunny forest clearings
are perfect for his hives.
But every year Mr Nakayama's hives
come under attack.
Whatever it is seems to be unfazed
by a swarm of angry bees.
Mr. Nakayama has put an electric fence
around his precious hives...
but even this doesn't seem
to be keeping the culprit out.
So, he's called in some experts
and they've set up an elaborate trap,
laden with honey.
All they can do now is wait
And it doesn't take long.
Within just a few hours, news comes in
that the trap's been tripped.
Professor Izumiyama
and his team are here to help.
Although it's wise
to tranquilise it first.
It's a young black bear.
He's strayed dangerously close
to the edge of human habitation,
looking for something to eat.
Black bears have attacked people
in the past.
So, for everyone's sake,
he can't stay here.
There's just enough room
for the bear in the boot.
He needs to be returned
to the safety of the mountain...
but it's a one-hour drive.
The bear could awake at any time.
And there's no cage.
In this rural area,
bear expert Professor Izumiyama
is used to taking this chance.
They need to take the bear as deep
into the mountain wilderness as possible.
This is the most anxious time
for the professor.
Thanks to Professor Izumiyama,
this lucky bear is back in the safety
of the forest and out of harm's way.
