Title: Why did this Leopard Mother Fight Her Own Daughter? | BBC Earth

With leopards, the female,
when she becomes ready to mate,
all of a sudden poses a threat
to the mother.
She almost takes the place of the mother,
which obviously wouldn't
really be tolerated.
When she picks up her daughter's scent,
the mother seems displeased.
It was as if she was smelling a female
from another territory,
rather than her daughter.
I knew that, from that point, the dynamic
between those two was going to change.
When they first made contact,
the mother just lay down
and let the cubs approach her.
The male sort of came up to her
and brushed past and moved off.
As the female started to approach,
the mother really started to snarl.
Every time the young female came close
to her, she was very hostile towards her.
and the daughter was, you know,
obviously not understanding
what was going on and persisting
and trying to make contact...
that familiarity that she's so used to.
She eventually got too close
and it ended up in quite a serious fight.
You can imagine the surprise
on the daughter's face.
It's just not something that
she would ever expect from her mother.
The message is unmistakable.
The daughter is no longer
one of the family.
