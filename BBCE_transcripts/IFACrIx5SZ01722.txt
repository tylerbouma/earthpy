Title: Attenborough: Amazing DIY Orangutans | BBC Earth

You might think
that this orang-utan is washing socks
as some kind of circus trick
for which she's been specially trained,
but not so.
She is doing this entirely
on her own initiative.
She's seen others doing it
and she's copying.
And that ability to imitate,
as well as to use tools,
is something which started among monkeys,
but has been brought
to a much greater level among the apes.
Those two talents were ultimately to lead
to the transformation of the world.
Camp Leakey in Borneo
is home to a special group of orangs,
who have been rescued from captivity
and returned to the wild.
Because they've lived
partly in our world as well as theirs,
they can give us an insight
into what we have in common.
This old lady loves DIY.
So does her son, who was born in the wild.
Even her infant is interested.
It's very striking when you sit as close
to an orang-utan as this
to see how similar
they are to human beings.
We are both, of course, great apes.
But look how human her hand is.
The skill with which she picks things up.
The way
that she can grasp a tool like that.
How she uses her brain to imitate
what she's seen others doing.
But the most important thing
we share is our big brain.
It's that that has produced
so many of the talents
and abilities that we have in common.
