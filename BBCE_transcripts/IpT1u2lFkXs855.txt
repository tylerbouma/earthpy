Title: Just How BIG are Elephant Seals? | Super Giant Animals | BBC Earth

For an idea of the scale
of the supergiant we're here to find,
I've got a selection of skulls.
This one belongs to a black bear
and these are found
right here in California.
But it's totally dwarfed by this one.
This is a grizzly bear.
And the canine teeth on this one
are about as long as my thumb.
This is in the record books as being
the largest land predator on Earth.
So...
this gargantuan skull must surely come
from some prehistoric dinosaur.
a sabre-toothed cat perhaps.
Well, actually,
this super giant is anything but extinct.
In fact, they're increasing in number.
There's said to be over 150,000 of them
and the best place to see them
is on the beach just over there.
These are elephant seals.
It's pretty obvious
where the name comes from.
With that size and skin...
and that extraordinary nose,
they do just look like swimming elephants.
Elephant seals are the biggest seals
on the planet.
The largest can be six metres long
and a whopping four tons.
I want to see for myself why
elephant seals have become super giants.
It's important to respect
their personal space.
Elephant seals
rarely cross paths with people.
But when they do,
they can really throw their weight around.
Up here on land,
they're impossibly ungainly
and out of place.
But for these female elephant seals
there's still one part of their life
where they're totally bound to the land.
They come here to give birth.
All right.
And to find a man.
It's the male elephant seals
that are the real super giants.
They're over three times heavier
than the females.
The males have to fight for mates.
The bigger they are,
the better their chances of success.
Thanks to scientists from the
University of California, Santa Cruz,
I can get hands-on with one
to see how it's equipped for battle.
He's been sedated
while the team attach a radio transmitter.
That's remarkable.
As the animal's breathing you can hear
the air resonating around that huge nose.
You can feel the vibrations
coming up from the ground.
It's like someone
revving a big motorbike right next to you.
Inside that mouth are four canine teeth
that look a little bit like that.
Particularly the two on the lower jaw
are angled forward like this...
and can be used in a stabbing motion.
If that was propelled at me,
I wouldn't last a second.
