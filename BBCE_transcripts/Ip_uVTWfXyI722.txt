interested in finding out how many words
a dog had learned you did you and seven
years ago he found the perfect students
shaking using crate loads of toys John
and his colleagues devised a
groundbreaking study of canine
intelligence the toys all have names
that chaser has learned throughout her
life and John picks eight at random

looked at the toys on the Manoir so to
pick the right object chaser has to
actually understand what he's saying

three years of intensive training chaser
