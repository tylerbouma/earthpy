The army ant.
This may look like a ball
of a million individuals,
but make no mistake...
the colony acts as one.
A super-organism with a sensory system
of two million antennae.
A skeleton made from
the living bodies of workers.
A defence system of soldier ants...
ready to act at any sign of danger.
A digestive system
processing piles of food deep inside.
Even a coordinated system
for dealing with all the waste.
These are insects that, by working
together, transcend individual size.
The colony can search the entire jungle...
and flush out its wildlife.
Each day, it sends out a silent probe
into the forest in quest of food.
It doesn't use scouts like other ants.
Instead, a vast search party
pushes into virgin territory...
seeking out the signs of anything alive.
They spread out along a ten-metre front...
sweeping across the forest floor.
To find prey,
the ants must first touch it.
The irony is that this,
the most successful hide-and-seek player
in the forest, is almost completely blind.
It distinguishes the living
only by their movement.
As long as an animal remains still,
it is safe.
But the slightest twitch
will give it away.
Within seconds, the prey is pinned down.
Within minutes,
it's torn apart at its joints.
The more the prey struggles,
the more the ants engage.
Right across the raid front,
prey of all sizes
are driven from their hiding places.
Even wasps must abandon their homes
when the ants arrive.
Everything alive in the path
of the raiders overwhelmed...
by sheer numbers.
