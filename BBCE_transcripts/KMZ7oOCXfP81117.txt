Title: Super Smart Dolphin Answers Questions | Extraordinary Animals | BBC Earth

For the first time ever, the Elvis project
allows the dolphins to use
echolocation as a pointing tool to make
choices and answer questions.
A series of shapes are projected
onto an underwater screen.
Each shape symbolizes
a different type of fish.
For example, a square means a mackerel,
a cross is a squid.
By aiming their echolocation beam
at a shape projected on the screen,
the dolphins can choose what type of fish
they want to eat.
The echolocation beam shows up as dots.
Green is a weak signal, white is strong.
Underwater hydrophones record
the echolocation sound signals.
The black dots here and there
are hydrophones 16, you know,
and the cable just takes the signals
from the hydrophone to the computer.
When the echolocation beam is
strong enough
for the computer to read the signal,
the trainer's whistle blows,
and the dolphins get their chosen reward.
Only three dolphins in the world
have been trained to do this.
Out of them, Luna was the quickest
to grasp the concept.
She manages to hit her chosen target
almost instantly every time.
Luna is a young dolphin and as such
a little bit more motivated.
She she likes to play,
to investigate things,
and she's very eager
to please the trainers.
Each run of the experiment
yields different results.
It allows Luna to choose
what she wants to eat.
Some days squid is her favorite,
on others its mackerel.
Here, the symbols for capelin and squid,
and these brown and green dots
are the trace of the sonar beam.
And now, Luna hit the squid symbol,
and then she made a little buzz
of happiness
that she managed to trigger it.
She can now go back to the trainer,
and she will be given a squid.
And when her work duties are over
for the day,
it's time
for some well-earned rest and play.
The Elvis system is still in its infancy.
Amandine hopes one day it could be used
for other projects,
including allowing dolphins
to choose toys,
play their own music
and even reveal their emotions.
