untameable
elusive and known for their secretive
nature
this solitary species native to the uk
is now britain's rarest carnival
the european wildcat
with some estimates stating there could
be as few as 35 left in scotland
the native wildcat to great britain is
now our rarest carnivore
many scientists and conservation groups
have been working
hard to ensure the wildcat's genetic
diversity is not lost forever
as hybridization with domestic cats has
highly contributed to the species rarity
[Music]
one way to combat this and to help the
species
is by having carefully looked after
breeding programmes
here the derek gao consultancy is part
of a breeding program
that is hopeful to reintroduce the wild
cat
back into england and wales one day
we met with peter cooper a
conservationist
at the consultancy who has helped
develop a strategy
on how this could be done and we wanted
to find out more
about breeding and caring for the uk's
rarest carnivore
so what is a scottish wildcat so i'll
catch out in the first bit there
so the word scotch wildcats actually a
bit of a misdemeanor because this is an
animal you once found
all over the uk and really it's only in
scotland now
because that's the one place that's left
with some suitable habitat they could
hang on to
while we wiped them out from the rest of
the country the wildcat was basically
seen along a lot of other
carnivorous mammals in this country as a
pest particularly with wild cat to
rabbits rabbit warrants are really
valuable medieval times
then as time went on basically to your
chickens anything you were keeping in
stock
the wild cat was seen as enemy number
one so huge numbers of wildcats are
wiped out from across england
to the point they're pretty much extinct
in england until the 1800s
and then by that time you also had game
shooting estates starting up people
rearing plenty of grouse plenty of
pheasants
and of course again while cats were
destroyed along with a lot of other
predatory mammals
so what you then saw was what was left
of the wildcats that had been
annihilated
were hanging on to western scotland
that's where the last wild cats were
left
and in fact they probably would have
gone extinct too were not for the first
world war
which ironically meant the gamekeepers
went to the front lines but didn't come
back
so the wildcats then began to come back
into scotland but what's the problem
then
there's far too few of them because we
destroyed so many in the past
that all they had to breed with were
domestic cats they had such a weak
population so over the last hundred
years what you've seen with the wildcats
in scotland is wildcats becoming more
and more
tabby cat your home cat basically the
point is virtually none left
and that's why they have now been
declared as function extinct in the uk
sadly
now we are one of quite a lot of zoos
and private collections around the uk
which are breeding wildcats as one big
coordinated plan
and the aim is yet to breed enough our
cats to go out into scotland
but also we hope into england and wales
eventually as well which is where the
wildcat once roamed
up until about 200 300 years ago and why
is there conservation so important
so the wild cat is our last remaining
cat species left after we
made the links extinct about a thousand
years ago wildcats as a predator
are part of this amazing network of
animals which actually regulate their
prey by controlling numbers but not just
the numbers of the prey but also how the
prey behaves it encourages prey to move
on
different areas for example which in the
case of wildcats you're looking at
things like rabbits and
mites and vols as the main prey base but
that in itself has amazing effects on
the rest of the ecosystem
now we know from larger predators like
wolves that they will change behavior of
deer and that will
make means a habitat can prosper by
reducing that grazing pressure
now we're not sure if a similar thing
happens to wildcats but i suspect that
it does it's something we can't
necessarily see ourselves
but there's so much you have to know
about egg systems so it's probably there
under the radar
and then almost certainly going to be
happening there with wildcat and an
ecosystem isn't really a fully
functioning system until you've got
every cog component back in place and
bear in mind in the uk that we have
completely sterilized our countryside
for years and years and years
putting back as much we can is so
important so putting the wildcat back in
there
as part of that very important predator
guild is so important
and of course the wildcat is very
symbolic of our world of nature
and i think if you can bring back
something like that and show it to
people who don't otherwise realize just
what spectacular history we do have in
britain
then that can only do good for
encountered people to conserve the magic
that really is the natural world
how many times a day do you feed them
and what do you feed them
so the wildcats will get fed about once
or twice a day and they get a really
nice mix of food here so they'll get
quail and rabbit and also some chicks as
well
and it'll also get a scattering of bits
of beef throughout the week
and that way they get a full spectrum of
nutrition for example the one day they
have a nice big meal to take into
other days you're looking for smaller
stuff scattered around the enclosure so
they're getting plenty enrichment out of
it
and the enclosures we have here are also
designed in such a way that they're big
enough for things like mice and bowls to
get through the gaps and i'm sure
they're catching live prayer as well
and that's really important because once
a wildcat makes that first live kill
it's a hunter from then on
these guys really do hold on to
predatory instincts quite quickly
so how many wildcats have you bred here
so we really started breeding
programming earnest last year and we had
our first litter of four kittens then
pleased to say we've had another litter
of four kittens this year and we've
always had another little two this year
so far as well so it's all going really
well
which is really really important for the
species and the kittens themselves are
really lovely as well to look at
and realistically can you see them
making
a comeback across great britain one day
i certainly do think so yeah so there
are no efforts underway to capture breed
wildcats to introduce into scotland
so they have just got the money to
settle and build a big category facility
up there and hopefully over the next
couple of years we will see wildcats
being released
up into scotland which would be really
nice to see and then what we're hoping
to do
is work our way towards actually seeing
wildcats released back into england and
wales
where they once roamed about 200 years
ago now this is something
that we'll only be able to do once we're
sure of places where the habitat is good
uh where the number of feral cats is
either
zero or low enough that won't create
much of an impact and that communities
are inside as well
whenever you release an animal that's a
carnivore that can potentially have an
impact
even if it is relatively small in
someone's lives it's really important
you get everyone on your side first
before you go out and release these
animals because cooperation is important
to conservation
but if we can meet all these criteria
then i think england and wales
really hosts a great place to release
wildcats if you look at europe where
there are still wildcats today
you'll find they're living in landscapes
that are very much like southern england
the woods small fields quite a mild
climate i think the habitat opportunity
in england wales is
really good so long as we can identify
good areas where they can go back
and we can get people inside then i
think yeah wildcat
has a good possibility of thriving for
england wales and scotland once again
it would be fantastic to see the wildcat
roaming across the entire of its natural
range once
more and despite the ongoing challenges
that the species faces
with careful conservation coupled with
breeding and reintroduction programs
maybe one day the wildcat will be a
familiar face of the british countryside
once more
