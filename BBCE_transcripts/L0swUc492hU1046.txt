It's early morning
and Mandy is boarding a bus
for her regular journey
to the training fields.
But today she has a big test ahead to see
if she's ready to join an elite team
on a mine-clearing mission to Mozambique.
In the past, dogs have been used
for mine detection,
but African pouch rats like Mandy
have distinct advantages.
Rats have some advantages to dogs.
That is, of course,
they're smaller in size.
They're much cheaper,
especially the transport.
Our animals which we're using,
they're almost blind,
or they don't see much
for they're night animals,
so they're completely depending
on the sense of smell and hearing.
So...and if you look at them,
they're sniffing all the time.
As with the TB training, Mandy and chums
have spent several months in laboratories,
tuning their noses to the smell of TNT,
the explosive in landmines.
Having completed this stage,
they put their nose to the test
in the field on a series of courses
designed to stretch
their mine-sniffing capabilities.
We use three meter,
and we call it contamination,
whereby we use iron and casings,
so we put them down in the field.
They have three-meter wide.
That's why we call them three meter.
Then the large one is used
with that system.
Then the latter goes to five meter.
The distance from each landmine is
much farther to make the rat work more,
to get, to find the landmines.
They are like humans. Some of them,
they are good. Some they're not good.
So they're different capabilities.
Mandy is one
of the rat school's high achievers.
Most take about a year to train,
but she has made it to the final test
in a mere eight months.
The rats have to do
a few hundred square meters
containing, let's say,
five, six, seven mines,
and they're not allowed to miss one mine,
and if they miss one mine,
they cannot operate on the mine.
Today,
nine real landmines have been hidden.
Mandy will have to find them
with 100% accuracy,
Guided by a search string which is
connected between the two trainers,
Mandy moves systematically
up and down the course,
processing lane by lane.
Every time she sniffs a mine,
she scratches the surface at the spot.
Weighing less than five kilograms,
she's too light
to set off the explosive device.
And when she indicates a mine,
she gets what she's in it for.
A click followed by a reward.
With nine mines to find,
that's a lot of bananas to eat,
and as Mandy's ever-expanding
pouches show, she's doing rather well.
They work for their foods
and they work a bit mechanical.
Once they know something,
they love to repeat it all the time.
As long as they know
they're going to get the food,
they're confident they can do the job.
So that makes them very well suited
for this job, you know.
Finally, when Mandy's cheeks can take
no more banana, the test is over.
She has passed with flying colors
and will head to Mozambique
on a mine clearing mission.
