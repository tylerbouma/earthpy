Title: Bison Fight for Mating Rights | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4eOhuLDfeU


For most of the year, bison bulls
and cows live separate lives...
but for a few weeks in late summer...
thousands congregate
in this Yellowstone Valley.
It's the rut, the mating season...
and the biggest bulls
are busy guarding their harems.
A dominant bull
might mate with over 50 females.
For the calves born this year,
now is the time
to stretch their young legs.
But as the herd grows, so tensions rise.
The rut takes a heavy toll
on the big bulls.
So, arriving now could give
this young contender an edge.
But there's life in the old bull yet.
Head-to-head, the challenger
more than holds his own.
Then he makes a small mistake.
Shunted aside,
his challenge is brutally ended.
The young bull gambled everything
and has paid a heavy price.
