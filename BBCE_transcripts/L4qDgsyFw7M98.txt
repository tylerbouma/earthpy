Title: Kilauea Volcano Eruption | A Perfect Planet | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4qDgsyFw7M


across the surface of our planet
there are over 1 active volcanoes
this is the most active kilauea in
hawaii
here magma liquid rock from the planet's
hot interior
bursts out through fractures in the
earth's crust
and it's been flowing for months
nothing can stand in the lava's way
[Music]
volcanoes are certainly destructive
but without these powerful underground
forces
there would be no breathable atmosphere
[Music]
no oceans
[Music]
no lands
no life
we can't control volcanoes but they're
vital
for all living things on planet earth
[Music]
you
