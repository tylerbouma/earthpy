Leopards are the most versatile
of all the big cats,
adept at finding cover
in the most unpromising places.
The steep walls of the gully
are now her cover for an ambush.
The male puku is close enough,
but he's too big to tackle.
She needs to slip past him
without being seen.
If he spots her, he'll blow her cover.
Slowly does it...
To succeed here, she needs to find prey
grazing close to the edge.
Or better still, in the gully itself.
Frustration.
Success would have staved off hunger
for a week.
But while there's prey around,
there's hope.
Peeking over the top is a risk...
but it's the quickest way
to find a new target.
A burst of speed of 65 kilometres an hour
and it's all over
in less than six seconds.
Except... it isn't.
Dazed and disorientated,
the impala makes a miraculous escape.
