Title: Hermit Crab Makes a Home from a Food Tin | BBC Earth

Hermit crabs protect themselves
by hiding their soft bodies
in the abandoned shells
of other creatures.
They live up to 30 years,
so, as they grow,
they need to upsize their homes.
But there's something of a housing crisis
on this island.
These idyllic hideaways
are a magnet for tourists,
who find it hard
to resist taking the occasional souvenir.
Every time a shell is removed,
a crab loses a potential new home.
So, these canny crabs have found
another source of housing.
Each evening, the rangers
clear the beaches, piling up the litter.
And now the crabs
do something extraordinary.
This hermit has found herself
a more modern home...
in a mackerel tin.
With so few shells around,
it's an ingenious solution.
And she's not alone.
This is a fast-growing trend.
An aluminium fizzy drink can
make a lightweight home...
that's worth fighting for.
Life in the mackerel tin isn't ideal...
and the local rangers know it.
So, they leave seashells
near the rubbish piles
to help the homeless crustaceans.
The crab normally winds its body
into the spiral of a shell.
It's far harder to grip
a straight and slippery can.
There are plenty of options.
It's all about finding a snug fit.
Well, she can be picky if she wants.
Moving house is an important decision.
At last, the perfect home.
