termite mound like this here's a very
easy way of just obscuring yourself from
your prey rich can you hear me if you
can shout out okay I look a lot better
in those sunglasses than you do Steve
reckons that he looks a lot better in
the sunglasses than I do that means you
can see us Bri these clouds but one
careless move a twig snaps and the
game's up I think I could see the
leopard about 30 yards out there I'm so
but I recognize him and I'm still 20
meters short of where a leopard would
launch its ambush but that doesn't stop
me
