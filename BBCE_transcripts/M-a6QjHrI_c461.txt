Title: Graceful Barn Owl Hunting in the Daytime | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-a6QjHrI_c


we think of barn owls as birds of dusk
and night haunters of the dark creatures
of the moon so to see them hunting by
day out here along the Essex seawall
startles me in daylight they resemble
apparitions the closest thing to ghosts
in the bird world
flying with a supernatural vigilance
[Music]
to me they set the land over which they
move a light with wildness they passed
through the air
these birds with the Silence of falling
snow
you
