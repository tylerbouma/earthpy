Title: Pregnant Polar Bear Hunts Seals to Survive Winter | Animals: The Inside Story | BBC Earth

Pregnant polar bears are also on notice.
At this time of year,
they're desperate for seals.
But seals aren't desperate to be eaten.
They have the fat the bears need,
but that fat also allows them to escape
under the ice.
This leaves a bear waiting
at a breathing hole,
hoping a seal will eventually use it.
A tactic that works about one time
in every 10.
This is one of the other nine.
One time in 10 is enough, though,
for the bear...
and her followers.
She can't let the success rate
get any lower.
If it does, a pregnant bear's
project is probably hopeless.
It's not only herself she has to get
through the winter...
but two growing babies.
Not until she sees the sun again in spring
will she know
that she ate enough fat in the summer.
It's a gamble.
The only way a female can win it now
is to settle into her den
and push her body to the limit.
Outside, the male bears keep on hunting.
As the ice sheet expands, their travels
to find food will get longer and longer.
But to get through their winter,
the females will have to travel...
through time.
To save energy for her babies,
a female has to cut her own energy use
almost to nothing.
Special hormones slow her
to a standstill...
and she goes into a deep sleep
that will last for months.
She won't eat, drink or defecate.
She'll just lie there
and get ever thinner.
