Title: Ants Ingenious Survival Method During Flood | Superswarm | BBC Earth

having come from the rainforest
the ants are used to this kind of
weather
but unknowingly the ants have built
their nest
in a drainage ditch
flooding is a challenge for even the
most intelligent swarm
the ants start an evacuation moving the
nest to higher ground
it's women and children first as the
ants carry the queen
and her pupae to safety
but still the water rises
the ants react by linking arms together
forming a mesh of interconnected bodies
between them they're making a life raft
the ants most precious cargo the eggs
and remaining pupae are safely stored on
top
flying ants also board like helicopters
on an aircraft carrier
ready to lift off to start a new colony
if the rat gets into trouble
remarkably some of the pupae are set
aside to act as flotation devices to
help keep the raft afloat
as the water level rises further the
raft
detaches from its moorings it is now at
the mercy of the wind and water
some of the workers paddle with her
front legs giving the elements a helping
hand
[Music]
on the top deck the workers tend the
pupae and larvae
below deck workers clean and maintain
the underside of the raft
[Music]
as the raft approaches land it begins to
change
shape
[Music]
the ants start building a pontoon from
the raft that reaches towards the bank
[Music]
the individuals are working as a unified
team for the benefit of the whole colony
as fingers of ants reach out they show
swarm intelligence working to perfection
[Music]
as more ants add to the pontoon's length
it becomes a bridge to the land
[Music]
once contact is made the most precious
cargo is unloaded first
like a team of porters they ferry the
pupae to the shore
the next generation is safe
the queen is next to disembark
the colony's future is assured
using their incredible swarm
intelligence fire ants
are taking on the world
as well as invading america they have
started to colonize australia
with global warming they are likely to
invade europe as far north as southern
england
