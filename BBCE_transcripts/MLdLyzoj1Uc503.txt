The bereaved couples are desperate.
They look for another chick to care for
and they don't mind
if it's someone else's.
They plan a kidnap.
The mother's defence is to sit tight
and stop her chick being stolen.
But the kidnappers
won't be put off easily.
Just in time, her partner returns,
spruced up from the shower.
He takes on the would-be kidnappers.
The fight gets even more heated,
but there are few tougher
than a rockhopper.
They can take the punishment,
as well as dish it out.
The baby-snatchers have had enough
and the male returns to his mate.
He might need another shower,
but at least his chick is safe.
Kidnapping is also rife
in the emperor colony.
The newly-walking chicks are irresistible
to females that have lost their own chicks
or failed to breed.
The mother tries to repel the kidnappers
with a few well-aimed pecks.
But they won't give up.
And others had the same idea.
The chick heads for the main colony,
hoping to find protection
among the crowds.
She disappears in a mass of bodies...
and reappears alone.
But it's only for a moment.
A large crowd has gathered,
all trying to adopt the chick.
She's soon overwhelmed by doting admirers.
One child snatcher tries to force
the chick into her pouch,
but she's way too big.
She makes a break for it,
then gives them the run-around
through the colony.
Finally, they have her surrounded.
They're all desperate to mother her.
She's in danger
of being smothered with love.
But the fluff ball
is accidently flipped away...
and caught by her mother.
She'll stay closer to her next time.
