By August the warmer temperatures
allow now the colony to break up.
Winter has taken its toll
and the males have lost
half their body weight
They're also left holding the baby.
These newly hatched chicks can expect
very little from their fathers.
After four months of fasting,
there's nothing solid in a male's stomach,
but he is able to produce
a protein-rich secretion.
but that is barely enough
to keep a chick alive for a week.
Fattened up from two months fishing,
the females reappear
with magically accurate timing.
In such a crowd, calling is the best way
to locate a partner.
A female arrives to take over.
At first, the male is a little reluctant
to abandon his offspring.
Once the exchange starts,
it needs to be quick.
A few minutes on the ice
would almost certainly kill the chick.
Now at last, the chick can feed properly.
During the next five months,
an emperor chick will eat
100 kilos of food.
In one big helping it can eat a third
of its own bodyweight.
Now at last their fathers
have a chance to eat,
but the ice edge may be
several hundred kilometres away.
Emperor penguins have a faster mode
of transport than just plain walking.
They can toboggan.
From now on males and females
will take turns to go fishing.
Each trip may involve travelling thousands
of kilometres, in search of food.
