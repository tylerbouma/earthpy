[Music]
this partnership has other benefits lots
of eyes to look out the dangers and the
lioness with hungry Cubs is as dangerous
as it gets an easy means just what she
needs a chance to show the Cubs how it's
done
she's picked the wrong
[Music]
[Music]
not quite the show of skill she had
intended
[Music]
beaten by a warlock
the failure she can take
cops hunger is more difficult to bear
[Music]
Carly is running out of time
her milk will soon run dry
[Music]
without her sisters they help catch a
meal this slim chance her Cubs will
survive
