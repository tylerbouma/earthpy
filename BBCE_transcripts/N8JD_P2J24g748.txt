It's March
and light returns to the High Arctic,
sweeping away four months of darkness.
A polar bear stirs.
She has been in her den the whole winter.
Her emergence
marks the beginning of spring.
After months of confinement underground,
she toboggans down the slope,
perhaps to clean her fur,
perhaps for sheer joy.
Her cubs gaze out of their bright
new world for the very first time.
The female calls them,
but this steep slope
is not the easiest place
to take your first steps.
But they are hungry
and eager to reach their mother,
whose delayed feeding them
on this special day.
Now she lures them
with the promise of milk,
the only food the cubs have known
since they were born deaf and blind,
beneath the snow some two months ago.
Their mother has not eaten for five months
and has lost half her body weight.
Now she converts the last of
her fat reserves into milk for her cubs.
The spring sun brings warmth,
but also a problem for the mother.
It starts to melt the sea ice.
That is where she hunts for the seals
she needs to feed her cubs
and she must get there
before the ice breaks up.
For now, though,
it's still minus 30 degrees
and the cubs must have
the shelter of the den.
