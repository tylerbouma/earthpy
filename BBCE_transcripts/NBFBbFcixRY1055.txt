Pansy the chimp's extraordinary skills
with human language have led researchers
to explore the little-known world of
chimpanzee communication.
At Twycross Zoo, primatologist
Dr. Katja Liebal is investigating
the methods of communication
chimps choose amongst themselves.
Although chimps can't speak,
they use a range of gestures
and facial expressions
as a way of communicating.
Chimps don't need language
in their environment
because they have a very complex
communicative system
based on nonverbal communication.
By observing many different groups
of chimpanzees,
Katja hopes to compile
the world's first chimp dictionary.
The Twycross chimps are
a useful group to study.
There's an ongoing power struggle
between the dominant male Kip
and a young teenage challenger
named Peter.
Fights between the pair are commonplace.
The tension is producing
a rich and varied array
of chimp communication
across the whole group.
The first gesture noticed by Katja
comes as a direct result of the fight.
Peter is spotted making
a facial expression that signifies fear.
The corners of the mouth are
really withdrawn,
and you can see the teeth.
They also do this when they scream,
so it can be slightly open.
Chimps also have a facial expression
for playfulness.
The mouth is open and the teeth are
still covered with the lips.
It would be like this,
so this would be a play face.
In this interaction, we can see Kip
and William all chasing around,
and you can see
that it's a play for interaction
because William actually has a play face.
But chimps gestures can be far more subtle
than mere facial expressions.
Immediately after their fight,
Peter taps Kip lightly on the shoulder.
It's "chimp" for saying sorry.
The individual that lost the fight
will approach the more dominant one
and will extend its arm
to ask for reconciliation,
so this is an expression
of submissive behavior.
The chimps also show such communications
as displaying,
which means, "I'm the boss,"
pouting, which means,
"give me some food please,"
grooming, which means,
"I am your friend and supporter."
Pretending to bite means,
"I'm enjoying this play fight."
All of these behaviors reinforce
social bonds, communicate feelings
and establish who is in charge
of the group.
They even perform actions
that seem all too human.
But while chimps across the world
only have
a limited repertoire of vocalizations,
they constantly invent and share
new gestures with each other.
One theory basically is that they imitate
gestures from each other.
They learned their gestures
by interacting with others.
The theory that chimps imitate
each other's gestures
has led some primatologist to believe
that this behavior may have
also been present
in the ancient ancestors of humans,
and may have led to the languages
that we all use today.
