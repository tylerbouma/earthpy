Title: Young Lions Attack Oryx | BBC Earth

In the Serengeti,
youngsters spend years watching
how older lionesses tackle large prey.
However, it looks as though these cubs
will have to teach themselves
through trial and error.
They begin the stalk
like seasoned hunters,
using the scant cover
to conceal themselves.
And they have to be incredibly quiet.
Oryx are spooked by the slightest sound.
One of the youngsters
looks as though it's made a mistake.
It's broken cover.
Actually, very cleverly, it's pushing
the oryx towards the other lion.
An oryx is quite capable
of seeing off a lion,
as long as the antelope stands its ground
and doesn't run,
but will the oryx keep its nerve?
Finally, the youngsters lose heart.
