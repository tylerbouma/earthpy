Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKzAJjeWB0


i'm dan o'neill
a biologist and filmmaker and i'm on a
mission to find out what it takes to
save an
endangered species join me on an
expedition to the mountains of
kyrgyzstan
as i learn first hand how this country
has brought snow leopards back from the
brick
work
in this episode i head up into the
mountains of the sarichat reserve
with a real adventure scientist he's
going to show me what snow leopard
conservation
means to the people who live in these
remote regions and to see what it takes
to gather data on an almost invisible
big
cat it's like a ghost of the mountains
i think it's a phantom who's there but
you never see it
we're in bishkek and we're just about to
meet uh kuban zumabai ullu who is the
director and founder of the snow leopard
foundation here in kyrgyzstan
uh him and i have been speaking kind of
on and off for about a year a year and a
half now about getting out here and
doing an expedition together
to set camera traps and hopefully see a
snail up in the wild
hey hi cuban how are you good come how
are you
very good thank you i'll see you come
come please
here you can see how many individuals
we identified and every single one of
these is a different snail of it yeah
these are different numbers so we try to
find good images of each individuals
from both sides
james jessica alba yeah
i have a selfie with this smaller but
you had a selfie with that cat
oh my god how many have you seen in the
wild
with your own eyes two times three times
then you know that it's very hard to
find this animal in the wild you know i
mean
i mean they see us first you know that
they are around
and then they are very well camouflaged
so it's hard to
find them people say that it's the
wildlife
encounter that you can have um
so yeah well it's been my dream for a
very very long time and i think you'll
find it
said hi i'm gonna hold you to that yeah
yeah um nice okay well i can see you've
planned it all out over here already
yes so i was working on these locations
where we set up camera taps
and then i want to show this map to the
rangers and some cameras you know
when setting up we have to change the
angle because animals come but
you can't get exact spots you know which
are important for identification of
individuals
so every coat is like a fingerprint yeah
it's like that yeah
so they have unique patterns on the fur
and then this helps us you know to
identify you've been camera shopping for
what seven years
in this reserve yeah why do you do it
what are you hoping to achieve
so we are comparing data from this area
with the us area where there is no
reserve
how big area is needed for one
individual we see
how they share this habitat with other
animals so we see how many
females give birth how they share this
area
how many cups stay with this mother two
years ago the scale of the task which
kuban and his team are undertaking
is starting to dawn on me this animal is
virtually impossible to observe
but with methodically collected camera
trap evidence kuban is building up a
robust scientific picture
of where these ghost-like cats live in
kyrgyzstan
so at 5am we pack up and set off
[Music]
i'm in safe hands kuban has made the
journey into the reserve more than 50
[Music]
times
[Music]
as we leave the city i feel proud and
excited to be a small part of something
much larger
than my own goal of seeing a snow
leopard but i wonder what chance i have
[Music]
even kuban who's dedicated seven years
of his life to seeing these animals
has only seen them three times
weird isn't it i wanted to see a snow
leopard for years
for years probably ever since i was a
little kid when i first saw one i
thought it was
a picture of something that wasn't real
um
a made-up animal and as you kind of
dream of becoming a wildlife filmmaker
and a biologist the snow leopard's
pretty much
the one animal that you really never
think you're going to be able to see
because who really gets to go into those
mountains
um and now we're looking at them with
our own eyes right up there
the foothills of the colossal tee and
shannon mountain range finally show
themselves and we begin our climb into
this remote landscape
it's not long before we've reached the
front line of snow leopard conservation
and then these guys search all the vans
and cars
for wildlife parts
she's a badass isn't she her name is
chile and she
knows the snow leopard smell and
our garlic cyber smells and we
when the suspicious cars comes and
i work with the chilean she
looks around the car and tries to find
her
that sense does she know the difference
between algali or snow leopard
yeah she knows really definitely
sometimes
some people text me by bringing some
horns of the
argalis or ibex and she finds
really yeah oh wow
snow leopards share these huge ranges
with remote villagers and herders
so global or national conservation means
nothing
if the local people aren't on board
snow leopards have been known to kill
sheep and goats belonging to these
people
yet kuban is a welcome face in this
isolated village
he takes me to meet the people to see
how a local scheme
which the snow leopard foundation have
come up with works
well coming you to this place
thank you very much thank you for
welcoming us
so what's this meeting about today
together with this community we
uh we made a local project data which
borders with uh
and if there is no poaching by local
people on trade species and smaller
parts
they get additional bonus from our
organization so there was no poaching on
snow leopards
no poaching on wild prey
so i want to pass this money now to our
local leader chopin
so this is primarily because of
handicraft
so they are protecting this area well
now you can come out from this village
and see our galleries on the slopes
that's amazing so it's a real actual
monetary value
associated with conservation and does
most of the money come
from creating these handicrafts
and it's just struck me how amazing this
is because it's
a resource they wouldn't otherwise be
using it's hard world they don't usually
use
and they're turning that non-usable
resource into something to create
handicrafts that then the snow leopard
trusts are selling all around the world
giving them direct income and the
arrangement and the agreement they have
is that they get this income and they
get this collaboration with the snyder
trust
because they're protecting this
environment which to me is amazing
because in
all conservation agreements and
most conservation um initiatives there's
always some kind of sacrifice but here
there's no sacrifice whatsoever because
these women who wouldn't typically be
making their own income here now have
their own source of income
creating these handicrafts which are
then being sold by the snow level truss
all around the world uh making a pretty
good income for them that these guys
made
15 000 us dollars last year in these
handicrafts alone
which are made of wool products that
they would have otherwise been throwing
away it's a world that they can't make
clothes out of it's too hard
and so yeah i think it's an incredible
initiative can't believe it
back on the road we need to reach the
rangers cabin before nightfall
these rangers are locals too many of
their families make crafts for the snow
leopard truss
like we saw in the village
as night falls so does the temperature
these are brutal conditions
if your car is broken and if you if you
stay in that place
and if you don't have any heating inside
i think you'll die
if you have no petrol to hit inside
no gas stove
[Music]
just crossed a river a frozen river
and a very heavy jeep
after 14 hours we finally reached the
cabin where we'll spend the night
[Music]
welcome to hotel california it
immediately strikes me just how tough
these rangers need to be
working with limited provisions and
equipment in one of the harshest
environments on earth
luckily for us they arrived earlier and
have lit a fire
taking the edge off the -15 conditions
well yeah 4028 meters
never been this higher before and i'm
starting to get a bit of a headache and
feeling very light-headed
it's freezing cold
i really do feel like we're on top of
the world but it does feel amazing
it's a completely different type of
remote something i've never experienced
before
and it's weird to think that actually
there's a lot of wildlife here
there's bears there's walls and
somewhere
there are snow leopards
[Music]
we all try to get some sleep
seeing how the local economy is
supported is a vital part of the story
here in kyrgyzstan
but if you can't prove an animal exists
you can't save it
join me next time as i explore the wild
and remote kingdom of the snow leopard
and i learn how to set camera traps that
capture the secret lives of these
ghostly cats
[Music]
you
