i'm dan o'neill
a biologist and filmmaker and i'm on a
mission to find out what it takes to
save
an endangered species
[Music]
join me on an expedition to the
mountains of kyrgyzstan
as i learn first hand how this country
has brought snow leopards
back from the brink this is tough
[Music]
in this last leg of our journey we
venture deep into the heart of the
remote and rugged sarichat reserve
yeah to plant more camera traps and
pinning all our hopes on spotting
a snow leopard it's like a ghost of the
mountains
i think it's a phantom who's there but
you never see it
stop is i can't i can't roll my eyes
oh so you're navigating yeah that's it
this is elissa my horse i'm just packing
her up
because we are going off in
that direction now um for about four
hours
to set some more camera traps uh some
rangers have gone over there
um some other guys have gone way way off
in that direction
and we're yeah tossed over there
it's funny because um if sultan doesn't
hold on
to um this girl here apparently she will
just
bolt as far as the eye can see into the
distance
our route takes us in some pretty rough
terrain
[Applause]
hey
we're relying on these semi-wild horses
to do it
hardly reassuring when the nearest
hospital is two days drive away
yeah good weather's changed we've got
our first snow in the mountains
you've seen up there it looks like a
prime snow leopard cave
and i bet there's like 40 50 snow
leopards in there that's when they go
for team
that is probably the most beautiful view
i've ever seen in my life
it's stunning isn't it
check out this view that doesn't look
real
yeah this looks like proper cat habitat
these little trails along these straight
cliff edges
and this plane here is the perfect
ground for
their prey the argali the ibex to come
up
into their lair yeah
when i catch up with kuban he tells me
something that brings me back down to
earth
this really is long but it goes to
huntington's session
in 2010 we apprehended one poacher here
right here and he pretended that he was
chasing wolf but
but you wouldn't chase wolf so long you
know
and then we compensated his gun so again
people from this underground concession
brought to
canadian hunters sea hunters
and then they showed one argali there
and then
two ibex in the reserve
it's just really sad this feels like one
of those last
truly remote places and even here
is still at risk imagine someone will
come and say
okay if you let me hunt here i will
give you two thousand dollars and these
guys sell it is hundred dollars
you know yeah they will maybe let them
do that you know yeah yeah
[Music]
this is a problem when it comes to
conserving highly prized species
the world over but i'm reminded that for
these rangers
protecting snow leopards supports their
whole community
who make and sell crafts which are sold
around the world
but only if they protect the snow
leopards
[Music]
after another broken night of sleep we
set off
climbing higher still in minus 15
degrees
[Music]
kuban says he prefers coming here in
winter despite the cold
i'm there as there are more
opportunities of seeing wild snow
leopards
they were here but i didn't see see huge
one
huge one wow it's huge
you can see them really clearly so there
we go
there's the pad one two three four yeah
snow leopard bug marks three snow when
it snowed
this one is escape marking and then
there is another scrape here
yeah right there
that's amazing not even 24 hours ago
there up here right below us
and three snow leopards literally 24
hours ago
probably a mother and two older cubs
because the prince are so big
they were right here and there was one
two
three cats they walked down here god
knows where they've gone maybe they've
gone back up in the valley
maybe we'll see them now
with proof that we're in the right area
the teams set camera traps
in the hope that in six months time
they'll come back and find evidence of
snow leopards
maybe even a mother and her cubs
[Music]
but it's not foolproof so last year bear
came and then
moved our camera but there was another
camera tip and that bear broke that
camera
by setting multiple traps the team
covers their bases
so when we set up our character we
checked the camera tap
that one and it had very nice images
yeah
yeah in all 40 camera traps are placed
across the reserve
covering some 1 400 square kilometers
and the videos reveal an array of life
hard to imagine
in these stark and inhospitable
mountains
argali wolves ibex bears
hares marmot
and chuffs
with the weather closing in we press on
deeper into the reserve
to set the last few traps
you can see a huge one
here there is you didn't and then also
here's here
maybe from last night very fresh very
fresh
oh now that
is a strong smell but look dude
there's a camera trap right there
should we check we can check
it's not working maybe it's working
this camera recorded a family of three
snow leopards scent marking at this very
spot
earlier in the year
really cold but when we check
there's nothing just tiny movements
triggering the camera
i'm gonna just cut
is it working we set the trap in a new
position near the spray marks
which the team will get in a few months
time
all right it's working it's not happens
i've been here
but it's getting very snowy now it's
harder to see at the top of the ridges
harder to see i don't know
there's something in the air i feel
lucky today
oh my god this is
of practice and wildlife tracking skills
guide kuban
into a promising spot
and then something catches kuban's eye
i think it is if it's moving
that's no rock it's moving recording
it's moving recorded it needs to move
away maybe
holy
[Music]
oh my god dude just right there oh my
god it's moving i can't believe it
[Music]
oh my god
oh my god oh my god
oh my god you got so close you can see
it without the scope
oh my god look like is it a rock is it a
rock
god i need to look again
maybe there are two because the
left one is also maybe smoother you know
it's not going but there's something on
the left
is is it is that two is it just one
[Music]
[Music]
there's absolutely no denying now he's
just sat up he's looking right at us
he's moving his head around
that is a cat now there's a very big
snowy cat
[Music]
i didn't think we were going to see it
honestly
[Music]
i can't believe it i'm feeling good
it's like a mixture between utter
unadulterated happiness and like
the biggest sense of relief you can
possibly imagine
[Music]
we're looking at a snow leopard
oh my god look at it hundred percent
yeah it's an absolute smell
that's the face
what number snow leopard is this for you
number four i'm a fourth that's the
fourth
you've ever seen how long have you been
working here 50 60 times
i i don't count now you know
oh my god look it's gone see now it's
gone you know
we came in time you know
right time right place right place the
right time
just can't believe it yeah we found it
yeah
this is clearly an incredibly special
place sarah chat
and it makes total sense that this is
probably the place with the highest
density of snolifics
on the planet
[Music]
we know that uh the number of small
parts has increased
since we started working in this area
and i believe that we
did something you know in this you know
there are organizations
and then life has changed the economy
has changed but i know that we also did
something
here you know i'm i can say that i'm
proud of this
it's hard to think about it you know
that that someone will come here and
damage this place you know
we should keep it we don't know we don't
have this kind of places in the world
yeah we should keep it
[Music]
in a situation where i thought maybe i'd
be coming here
and we kind of follow a sad declining
story of an animal that's
moving its way towards extinction it's
not even a glimmer but
such a strong feeling of hope that
because these people are working
together in those four pillars that
costed talks about the
community-based conservation the
research policy and education
all working together that's how you keep
an animal like this alive that's how you
keep snow leopards living in these
mountain habitats and that's how you get
things like seeing two snow leopards in
one day
and it gets me excited for the future
that models like this might work for not
just these animals but
for countless other endangered species
[Music]
