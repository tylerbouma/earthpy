Title: Tiger Shark Attack! | Benedict Cumberbatch Narrates South Pacific | BBC Earth

Every year, in June,
tiger sharks appear in the shallow waters
around this scattering of tiny,
sandy islands.
They've travelled hundreds of kilometres
in anticipation
of an event that lasts
less than two weeks.
And their timing is impeccable.
Albatross chicks are sitting ducks.
The sharks may have lost
the element of surprise,
but their high visibility
will make little difference
to the albatross chicks' behaviour.
Right now, the focus is on flying.
For fledging albatross,
that's not as simple as you'd think.
The problem is the island's runway
is a bit short,
especially for a bird with one of
the world's longest wingspans.
The maiden flight often ends
in a wet landing,
and that's why the sharks are here.
With their highly acute senses,
they're onto the chicks
within a few moments of touchdown.
During two weeks of fledging,
over one hundred albatross chicks
make the same fatal error,
and the sharks take full advantage.
In an ocean where food
can be surprisingly scarce,
this annual feast is something
these sharks depend on.
