Title: Meet This Family of Mountain Gorillas | Cousins | BBC Earth

High in the Virunga volcanoes of Rwanda
live the largest of all the apes.
In these strange forests,
I hope to have my first-ever encounter
with mountain gorillas.
In the last few years,
this area's been ravaged by war.
and it's only very recently that it's been
possible to come and see the gorillas.
I'm really close now. I can't believe it.
The gorillas have been here. You can see
the ground's all been flattened.
This is where they've been
stripping bamboo and there's celery.
I can hear them just ahead.
That's apparently good gorilla manners
that you actually grunt
and let them know you're coming.
Here they are.
This is just... one of the most
fantastic moments of my life.
I can't believe I'm sitting here...
surrounded by mountain gorillas.
And right in front of me
is the silverback.
He's the dominant male.
On reaching full maturity,
males get silver-grey hair on their backs.
On the ground,
apes form larger, more organised groups...
and he is definitely the head
of his family.
Everyone seems to know
their correct place and acts accordingly.
They're just so calm and tranquil as well.
They're obviously having their rest break,
their siesta, after feeding.
A bit of recreation time
is also good for making friends.
Gorillas seem to have
a very strong sense of personal space,
and always choose to sit together
with their closest pals.
The younger ones, though,
can never sit still for long.
During these siesta breaks, the young ones
love to gather round the silverback.
You'd think he might be
a rather intimidating father,
but he's really very, very gentle
with them and also loves to play.
He's careful to curb his strength
when he does.
Wrestling with each other encourages
the youngsters, especially the males,
to be tough and test their strength...
but also to learn how to control it.
In these play sessions,
you can already see
distinct personalities emerging...
and some very special friendships forming.
During the siesta time, there's always
plenty going on among the adults, too.
A young male tries
to get intimate with a female.
But she's not remotely interested.
But not much happens
without the boss's say-so.
He can get pretty tough
if he thinks anyone's out of line.
He's got to be one of the most
impressive animals in the world.
He's 200 kilos!
He's definitely keeping his family
in order.
But it's not long
before everything calms down again.
It's lunchtime.
She's eating a mixed salad.
They're eating stuff called draquisha,
which is actually quite bitter.
What they do is they mix it...
That's very good.
The bamboo makes it really succulent.
A recipe for the Naked Chef's repertoire,
perhaps.
When watching the gorillas
I try to keep my distance,
as humans share all the same diseases
and can easily pass on a cold or flu.
But, of course,
the gorillas are oblivious to this.
The silverback decides
when it's time to move off
and then all his females follow him.
This is the other silverback,
the number two in the group.
There's suddenly a whole load of activity.
From being completely calm and quiet,
they're all moving.
The group head off a little way,
but a couple of adolescent males
hang back.
This is a black-back. They actually act
as like the rear-guard to the group.
These two are 11 and 13
and just like any young lads,
they're keen to show off,
especially in the presence of a film crew.
A good show of strength,
but has it impressed his friend?
It looks like there might be
a bit of one-upmanship going on here.
Okay, that was good,
but I wonder what's next?
Being kicked by a gorilla,
I think's a privilege.
But I'm hoping the other one
doesn't decide to go one better.
I try not to be pay too much attention.
Of course, that's one way of capping it.
An easy pushover.
Not that I was going to put up too much
resistance to 140 odd kilos of gorilla.
And now he looks
as pleased as Punch with himself.
I think that just might have won him
the contest.
The rest of the family group
has settled again nearby.
I get my first glimpse
of the newborn baby.
It's tiny.
It was probably just born last night.
The mother is called Mpanga
and this is her first.
Like many of the gorillas,
she lost her foot to a snare
and survived against the odds.
This baby is a good omen.
Gorillas face many dangers
and every new baby counts.
There are fewer than 350
of these mountain gorillas
left in the wild.
Over the last few decades,
they've been teetering
on the edge of extinction,
but despite poaching and recent wars,
they're still here.
thanks to international conservation
efforts and dedicated local people.
So long as those efforts continue, these
magnificent animals should have a future.
