Title: Filming Lions Hunting Elephants | Wild Stories | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK5zPFzRD64


the elephants dominate the waterhole but
as
night falls the balance of power will
shift
i was probably as frightened as i've
ever been all of a sudden
there was this extraordinary sound it
was like a sort of eruption of lions
roaring
right next to us and i just thought okay
we've upset them and they're all going
to jump on the vehicle and now i'm going
to get eaten alive
we all thought that
i'm johnny keeling and i work at the bbc
natural history unit
i've been there about 23 years i'm
currently an executive producer
but when we filmed lions hunting
elephants i was a producer and director
on planet earth one
lions hunting elephants was in the great
plains episode of the first planet earth
series
which was all the kind of grasslands all
the big open
plains so we featured the tibetan
plateau we featured
the um arctic tundra and we also
featured the african savanna where this
was set
africa had been filmed a lot so i really
wanted to find something new
with some of those big iconic animals
like lions
or or elephants it was one of the safari
rangers who we spoke to because we're
speaking to all different sorts of
people
you know from scientists to like i said
safari rangers and he
mentioned that in the morning when they
took out their tourists in the car
they would see an elephant carcass with
lions all around it
and they could hear them at night but no
one had been out at night
but they were suspecting that the male
lions killed the elephant and then
all the lions ate them in the morning
the reports i had were that there were
maybe 50 lines in the pride and i
thought even that's an impressive
view so we we took a gamble as you
always do in filmmaking you always have
to take a bit of a chance
we had infrared cameras on the car and
infrared light
we can't see the light and the animals
can't see the light
but the the cameras you could pick up a
black and white image of what was going
on around us so we had night vision
goggles and we had these infrared
cameras we could look through
we had a crew following the lions
through the day then we would pick them
up
an hour before sunset go through the
whole night so they're being followed
the lions 24 hours
the very first night i have to say
i was probably as frightened as i've
ever been we turned up as i said with
little information
we were quite naive which i think is
probably a useful thing to be in
filmmaking sometimes
we rigged all the vehicles with the
infrared lights and the infrared cameras
and then we drove out and we we heard
the lions roaring and we followed the
sound of the roar
we drove through the trees
all of a sudden there was this
extraordinary sound it was like a sort
of eruption of lions roaring
right next to us and the vehicles that
we were stood on were all open-backed
completely open-backed and quite low and
i just thought
okay we've upset them and they're all
going to jump on the vehicle and now i'm
going to get eaten alive we all thought
that
and a huge fight erupted once they'd
finished that they all settled down
but for about i think it's probably for
about 10 seconds
i just thought that that's it i actually
i'm not sort of
embarrassed or too embarrassed to admit
i just fell onto my knees and kind of
um clutch my head because i just thought
they're going to jump on the vehicle and
bite
me and actually we realized they didn't
care about us at all they were just
walking around the vehicle
and they were more interested in each
other they didn't recognize us as easy
prey which we were
they just sort of looked and then
carried on their business and they
didn't seem to care
the elephant's night vision is little
better than our own
but lions have much more sensitive eyes
we sort of quite quickly worked out how
the lions were behaving and then sit
around the waterhole and they would wait
and then out of the bushes would come
elephants because the elephants are sort
of walking at night i guess because it's
very hot
in the day and they'll come and have a
drink on the waterhole
the cats are hungry and the elephants
seem to sense it
the lions wouldn't attack every elephant
so my observation
was that the mother would come out the
trees with her youngster and she was in
a maternal herd
they probably wouldn't try and attack
because she would be ferocious and they
know that
if there was a single lone bull as well
a big bull coming out of the trees the
lions wouldn't be bothered
but if there was a sort of an adolescent
and isn't
particularly with a hurt and maybe it's
just left its mother
and it was coming by itself that's the
one they would go for
the lions when they're laying down
they'd all be asleep or seemingly asleep
but there might be one just on lookout
even before seeing an elephant emerge
from the trees it's almost like he could
hear
he could hear whether it was a youngster
he could hear whether it was a big adult
or it could hear from the right side
and somehow they all sat up almost
simultaneously and was like well how
have you communicated
across the others how have you woken
them up they would be up and running
within seconds
so we were trying to get the cameras
already and up and running
the solitary lion stands no chance
but the whole pride is here
and they had different roles and some
would bite at the legs and
usually there was one female she had a
scar on her shoulder so we could
recognize that
she would jump up and onto the back i
mean it's incredibly
brave it's not a nice thing to watch but
incredibly brave of her to jump on the
back of a moving elephant
at speed and ride that elephant while
the others were biting at the legs
and they would hopefully with their
weight sort of trip it over and bring it
down
we never saw a male doing that the males
would sort of run along by the side
roaring and causing a bit of chaos and
and i suppose they added to they helped
a little bit because they caused more
chaos and
panic and fear in the elephant they they
never really got involved in
trying to jump on the back it was the um
in this circumstance anyway it was the
females
doing all the hard work
when you see the footage you can see
everything because it's filmed with the
infrared cameras
but actually for us it's pitch black
you're sat
in a vehicle you may have been having
your sleep or rest time or you're
quite dozy because you've been up all
night for four or five weeks
and then all of a sudden there's lions
roaring
right next to you within maybe three
meters and there's
elephants charging through the
undergrowth and you're thinking
i just don't want the elephant to hit my
vehicle and not
knock me out or roll the vehicle and
then we're all it's going to be even
more chaotic on the one hand it was
fascinating because
we were kind of doing our own research
we were sort of watching the lions and
seeing how they behaved because we
needed to be sort of anticipating what
they were going to do
and you could see this sort of behavior
and how clever they were how strategic
you know where they laid
between waterholes they knew when and
where the elephants were going to come
out
of the trees and when they were going to
drink but that
on the sort of downside really it was
just heartbreaking to see a beautiful
large animal like an elephant just kind
of pulled down
by by lions and then eaten
this elephant will feed the whole pride
for at least a week it was quite naive
and
thought yeah we're going to get this
behavior i want to get it and then when
we filmed it i just was left
feeling quite empty with it like oh no
we've got it but i don't feel elated i
just feel
sad for the elephant but it was worth it
because
it's capturing a new piece of behavior
and i think that
giving people a fascination and a wonder
of the natural world is a really
um it's a really important thing to do i
think anyway and i think we were able to
do that on planet earth
i mean i hope that audiences would look
at it and just
i want them to be surprised i don't want
them to be shocked particularly but i
want them to be surprised and think i
never would have imagined
that lions could be taking on an
elephant it's an adventure
in the true sense of the word and that
you you do not know
what the outcome is going to be and i
love that you know particularly about
wildlife you don't you don't know
how the animals are gonna behave and to
know that the natural world
is full of the unexpected it's full of
surprise
you
