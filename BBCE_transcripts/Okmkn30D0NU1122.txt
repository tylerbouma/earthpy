Theory of mind is this general idea
that I can understand
that my thoughts are different
than someone else's,
or in fact everyone else's,
and that I have a sense of self
that I recognize is different
than everyone else.
And one of the easiest ways
to demonstrate that
is being able
to recognize yourself in a mirror.
Mirror self-recognition is not an ability
humans are born with.
To demonstrate this, Rob has gathered
together some very young volunteers
and secretly daubed them
with a spot of paint.
Where's the mirror? Where's the mirror?
If they use the mirror
to examine the spot,
they'll demonstrate that they understand
that the image in the mirror
is themselves.
We just don't expect mere self-recognition
much before a year and a half old
or even two-years old.
We did test one child
who was a little bit over three-years old,
and she instantly recognized
the spot on her forehead,
and that's exactly what you would expect.
Now, that's something that a two-year-old
simply can't do.
So if young humans can't do it,
how good are orangutans
at self-recognition?
To find out, Rob installed
a two-way mirror in the lab.
Meanwhile, Rob's colleague Carol Schwartz
prepares AZ and his female friend Kenobi.
She's always interested in the mirror.
She's always interested in activities.
So I think she'll be quite good today.
Kenobi is the first to take the test.
Cause he did it. Good.
This is the clearest marker
I've ever seen.
Kenobi passes with flying colors.
Why don't you just have the cup?
But shy, retiring AZ has
never bothered much with mirrors before.
Thank you.
His reaction to the mirror may be
altogether more fleeting and subtle.
AZ has never had a mark test
to my knowledge,
so he may or may not pass
the mark test. We'll find out.
Although AZ was less flamboyant
than Kenobi, his reaction is clear.
When we look at the responses,
Kenobi's was extraordinarily eazy
to interpret.
AZ's was a bit more subtle,
but I think still convincing.
AZ's capacity to recognize himself
as well as long-lost friends
shows that orangutans are far more aware
than previously thought.
