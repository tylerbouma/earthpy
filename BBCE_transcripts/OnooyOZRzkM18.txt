the rains have arrived in the mountains
of east africa
one of the most organized swarms on
earth has appeared above ground
they are driver ants an insect with a
fearsome reputation
[Music]
in the rainy season they form these
extraordinary hunting trails
large soldier ants line the trail
protecting the smaller workers inside
their massive jaws create an impregnable
barricade
the soldiers create these protective
tunnels whenever they cross open ground
[Music]
the trails radiate from the nest in
every direction
some stretch 100 meters a worker running
at full pelt
takes 45 minutes to run its length
the soldiers protect the trail at any
cost
although blind they are highly sensitive
to vibrations and air currents
and become instantly defensive when
under attack
stress pheromones put the whole task
force on alert
they are ready to take on anything
including people
they are programmed to keep the trail
moving or die
trying
driver ants are the stuff of legend
it is said that they kill everything
that crosses their path
it is said that no animal is safe when
they're on the warpath
it is even said that they will enter
huts to attack people or kill babies
left unattended in their courts
the truth is somewhat different although
the bites are painful against people
they are purely defensive
the jaws may slice through human flesh
like butter
but it's simply a warning
despite the myths driver ants are still
ruthless
killers but in a way that often benefits
the villagers
dangerous pests like scorpions are
quickly set upon by the ants
even the scorpion's deadly sting is
powerless against this invincible army
both workers and soldiers join the
attack dividing up their rules according
to their size
as some look for a in its leg
armor others prise open its body plates
like a tin opener
with its sting immobilized and faced by
such overwhelming odds
the scorpion eventually gives up the
fight
the dismembered body is hauled back down
the trail to feed the nest
the farmers fields provide even more
opportunities for the attack force
pests disturbed by digging are soon
dispatched by hundreds of
razor sharp jaws
the ants make a clean sweep capturing up
to one hundred thousand
insects in a single raid
despite the ant's formidable reputation
most farmers value their role as pest
controllers
their feelings
[Music]
