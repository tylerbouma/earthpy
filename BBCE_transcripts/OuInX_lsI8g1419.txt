sometimes animals take parts of the
plant that the plant doesn't mean to be
eaten the leaves for instance
these leafcutter ants logs yuriatin and
never-ending supply of leaves
the ants don't eat the leaves they cut
they take them back to other members of
a colony will grind them into a mulch
for growing fungus then the ants eat the
fungus
it's a cultivated crop needing constant
supplies
