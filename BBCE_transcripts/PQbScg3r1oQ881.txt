Spider silk, with the scent of a female.
He just needs to follow it...
wherever it leads him.
Other males have gone on the same quest
and have come to a grisly end.
Here's the female
and she doesn't look very amorous.
In fact, she kills every male
who doesn't match up to her expectations.
What can he do to win her over?
Dance.
Dance for his life.
He will need a show-stopping trick
to avoid becoming lunch.
With his fan unfurled,
he begins an ever more complicated series
of dance moves to try and seduce her.
At last, she succumbs to his advances
and allows him to mate with her.
He matched her expectations.
But she kills him anyway.
