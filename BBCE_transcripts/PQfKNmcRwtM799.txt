Frank and the team
are fitting Edison's tracking collar.
So this is a new type of collar
that we're trialling.
It's a little bit easier to put on
than the other ones.
Instead of having a big lead weight
at the bottom,
all the brains are down
in the weight as well.
It may look big, but for an elephant
it's just like wearing a watch.
The collar is on,
now it's time to wake Edison up
We're just going to jump back in the car.
After 16 minutes,
the antidote has just gone in,
so let's wait and see how long it takes
him to wake up and hopefully, he does.
The antidote counteracts the effects
of the tranquilizer.
All going to plan, Edison should be back
on his feet within a couple of minutes
But he's not.
This is when everything stops
and everything gets quiet.
The second hand seems to go
around the watch a bit slower.
You wait for him to to get up.
The first sign we will be looking for
is his ear twitching.
It's normally just a couple of minutes,
isn't it?
He's been down too long
and they're worried.
Vet Matthew Mutinder,
administers another shot of antidote.
My heart really isn't on earth.
-Have you seen this before George?
-Yeah.
I don't this at all.
He just took his time.
Oh, thank God.
That's a big relief.
He's paying a lot of attention to it,
he's sniffing it,
thinking what the hell is this thing,
why am I wearing a necklace suddenly?
I've only done about ten of them.
Every elephant that I have been involved
in collaring
leaves you with a special attachment
to that elephant.
It's like, when you follow them
on the tracking system
you know what they're like
and you feel a connection.
And suddenly when you see them,
it's like seeing an old friend again.
That's why I'll always have a feeling
for Edison.
