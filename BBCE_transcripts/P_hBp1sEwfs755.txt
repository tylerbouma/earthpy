Title: Giant Horse Conch & Burglar Hermit Crabs | Blue Planet | BBC Earth

So now, for this tulip snail,
it appears safe to patrol the channels
in search of a meal.
But is it?
This is a rather bigger kind of snail.
At five kilograms in weight,
the giant horse conch
has little to fear from any shark
and it has a taste for tulip snail.
Sensing the approaching danger,
the snail flees.
But in a world of snail paces,
the conch is something of a Ferrari.
It calls for desperate measures.
Exhausted by the effort
of its last-ditch attempt,
the tulip snail is slowly gunned down.
The tide still has to rise
for another hour
before the big predators can feed.
But out on the flats, the scent
of dying snail wafts away on the tide.
It's a scent
that these hermit crabs are partial to.
It's vital that the crabs
have the best possible protection
from the heavy teeth
of the waiting sharks and rays.
For that, they need
the shell with a perfect fit.
Today, there is new real estate on offer
and competition
in this housing market is fierce.
The action becomes even more desperate
when the shell of the devoured snail
is ready for release.
This crab simply can't wait any longer.
But it's a decidedly risky acquisition.
The risk paid off handsomely.
The new shell is both lighter
and stronger than the old home
and it's not a moment too soon,
because the tide is flowing in strongly,
flooding the plains.
