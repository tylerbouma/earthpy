A couple of days later,
I can't believe the pack's luck.
A herd of muskox
are grazing in our valley.
They are huge.
Now that is one animal I'm scared of
and they've got a bad attitude
towards anything
that looks like a predator.
Right, I'm not too happy about this
'cause the muskox
are coming straight towards me.
I'm in a very dangerous position,
trapped between the wolves and their prey.
Now, this could get interesting.
How's this going to play out?
It looks like they're going to cross
right over towards the wolves.
It's crazy.
Muskox pose a danger to the pups.
The wolves are up on their feet.
They're heading right up towards
the wolves. Holy mackerel...
Now, these wolves are going
to have to spring into action.
My God...
They're really relaxed.
God, these wolves are super cool.
My wolves are hungry,
but this is a big herd.
The pack are outnumbered two to one.
It's not often that a meal
comes straight towards a wolf
but that's what seems
to have happened here.
Now, the wolves have to really think
carefully whether this is worth it,
whether they stand a chance.
Oh, she's making a go for it!
Luna and Romulus lead the charge.
They're going for it.
They're going for the muskox.
They're going for the muskox.
Jesus, they've set panic in
amongst the herd.
They don't want them to get up on the hill
'cause they'll lose them on the flat.
Oh, my God, this is unbelievable!
The muskox have regained the advantage.
Two massive bulls, about ten females.
Maybe they don't stand a chance? Crikey.
A huge bull senses their desperation.
In the confusion, the herd make a break...
Oh, my word!
...with Luna and Romulus in pursuit.
That was exciting.
