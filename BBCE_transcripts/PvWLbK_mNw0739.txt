There will be no easy
meals on this island.
Walruses are the largest seals
in the world.
They weigh over a ton
and are armed with tusks a metre long.
Exhausted from his swim,
the bear must regain his strength.
The next day,
a sea fog shrouds the island.
The walruses sense that they're in danger.
Using the fog as cover,
the bear approaches the herd.
The adults close ranks around their young,
presenting a wall of blubber and hide.
He tests the barrier, but it stands firm.
It appears that the world's largest
land carnivore has met his match.
There must be a chink
in the armour somewhere.
Not here!
This female walrus is shielding her pup.
If he can just prise her off...
The bear's claws and teeth
can't penetrate her thick hide.
With the herd retreating to water,
the bear must move quickly.
Having failed with one,
he heads straight for another.
The chance of his first meal in months
is slipping away.
He seems increasingly desperate.
It's now or never.
He must avoid the stabbing tusks
if he is to win.
The flailing walrus is immensely powerful
and drags the bear away from the shallows
towards the safety of the herd.
It slips from his grasp.
