after what we've just seen
diving with wild killer whales might
seem an extreme form of recklessness
this is dis fjord in Norway for several
years a local dive operator has been
offering tourists a unique encounter
with wild killer whales
up till now there have been no signs of
aggression from the whales nor even an
accident yet we've seen that some killer
whales regularly target mammals as their
prey humans are much the same size as
sea lands and much easier targets
[Music]
if killer whales were purely
opportunistic predators a slow-moving
snorkeler would be the easiest prey in
the world
