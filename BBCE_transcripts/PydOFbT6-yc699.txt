Title: Young Leopard Steals Kill From Mother | Africa | BBC Earth

This young leopard is just a year old,
and at a critical point in his life.
His mother has battled
to raise her two cubs,
but finding enough food for them
is now beyond her.
From today,
he'll have to fend for himself.
Kalahari means "land of great thirst".
Prey is scarce.
Of all the leopards in Africa,
these have to be the most resourceful.
A big warthog.
Potential prey...
but armed and dangerous.
His mother tried to tackle one,
but it nearly killed her.
He spots something more promising.
A steenbok.
That's more like it.
He won't strike unless he can get
to within just four metres
and without making the slightest sound.
A jackal barks an alarm.
But the steenbok still has no idea
it's being stalked.
The nearer he gets,
the quieter he must be.
He's blown it.
A good opportunity like that
won't come around very often.
Hungry and thirsty, he heads back home...
and spots a kill stashed in a tree,
almost certainly by his own mother.
And, like any teenager,
he thinks nothing of raiding her larder.
Booby trapped.
It's not really his day, is it?
