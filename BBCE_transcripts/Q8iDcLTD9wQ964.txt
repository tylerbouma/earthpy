Title: Whales' Bubble Net Fishing | Nature's Great Events | BBC Earth

The Inuit echo to the sound
of a mysterious song.
A curtain of bubbles and a haunting call
hold the secret
to an ingenious way of fishing.
This is bubble net feeding.
A dozen whales work together
to harvest the herring bonanza.
Such fishing requires an extraordinary
level of intelligence and cooperation.
The lead whale dives first.
She is the bubble blower.
It's her job to find the fish.
The rest follow in formation.
Each takes exactly the same position
in every lunge.
Once she's located the fish,
the leader blows a net of bubbles
and completely encircles the shoal.
Another whale calls to synchronize
the group.
Panicked by the eerie sound
and the blinding bubbles,
the fish won't cross this fizzing curtain.
As few as a hundred humpbacks have
learnt how to feed as a team like this.
And this is the only place on the planet
where whales fish in this way.
