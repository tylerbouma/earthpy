lead female is too dangerous

gone down she's up again feeling rather
woozy number one mum leads the head into
the pegs once inside the crush Sean
discovers one of the mums isn't
producing any make
splits the babies he's forced to make a
difficult decision three adult females
one of the females dry now it's too much
a risk for us to actually put a baby in
the group and hope that it'll suckle so
we've made a decision now to take all
three babies away from the screw there's
a Jersey card on me right now which has
raised Buffalo before and then hopefully
it'll raise these three Daisy lives at
printers hook the milk from a Jersey cow
is extremely rich perfect for Buffalo

we've done is we've taken them up we've

and they'll be happy really happy
