Title: Tiny Orphan Baby Sloth Rescued | BBC Earth

It's crazy. You really can't plan
anything around here.
We've just had a call
from the fire department
saying they've found a baby sloth.
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Max.
They say it's a newborn baby sloth.
I don't know
if it's two-toed or three-toed.
I don't know anything other than
we have to go meet them now.
Let's jump in.
Luckily it's only a 20-minute drive
to the fire station
in the nearby town of Quepos.
It's crazy. Sometimes it's a whirlwind,
but when a new animal comes in,
especially something like a baby sloth,
you have to react really quickly,
go right away,
because every day, every hour,
every minute can make a difference
in whether they survive or not.
Give me directions. I've got no idea
where the fire station is.
Just keep going.
You're going the right way.
-Wow!
-Aw!
-It's barely got any hair!
-It's right there.
Aw! It's a two-toed.
It looks brand new.
-It's absolutely tiny, isn't it?
-Tiny. Is it okay if I...?
Hi!
How many days old do you think
this little guy could be?
I'll do a better exam once we get
to the clinic, but mere days old.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
What did the guy say?
Where did they find him?
Apparently there was a couple
walking along the beach this morning
and they heard him crying.
They make a really loud crying noise
when they're not with their mothers.
So they found him
and they looked everywhere for the mum
but they couldn't find her anywhere.
That's when they called 911.
This is definitely a newborn that we're
dealing with. This is going to be tricky.
The first stop is the centre's clinic
for a thorough check over.
So, I'm just going to look over his body
and see if we see any kind of wounds,
or anything that's abnormal.
He looks good. I don't see
any wounds at all, so that's good.
Let's turn him over and look at his belly.
So, his belly button, the umbilical cord
is gone, but it's still inflamed.
So, it looks like the umbilical cord
came off very recently.
-He's really gripping on though.
-The last thing that goes is their grip.
The fact that he still has an extremely
strong grip, that's really good.
He's actually 275 grams.
Very small and he's at the bottom
of the normal weight range
for two-toed sloths.
Honestly, he's just so tiny that...
before we give him a proper name,
I think we'll just call him Tiny.
Tiny is the smallest sloth
that Sam has ever looked after
and, at this age, one of
the biggest risks is dehydration.
All right, bud, here we go.
It's critical that Sam
can get fluids into him fast.
Oh, my gosh! Look!
Good job, bud.
That's amazing. That's...
This is like the best result
that we could possible hope for,
because not only does he want to drink,
but he clearly knows what he's doing.
He's just so ridiculously tiny. How much
fluid do you need to get inside him?
If I could get five millilitres in him,
I think that would be
a pretty good place to start for now
and at the next feeding
in a couple of hours I'll try again
and just keep going like that
throughout the day.
Tiny is just so small.
I don't think I've ever seen
a baby animal this vulnerable.
For Sam, it's going to be
a massive commitment.
She's got to look after him 24/7,
feeding him every few hours
and she's probably not going
to get much sleep.
