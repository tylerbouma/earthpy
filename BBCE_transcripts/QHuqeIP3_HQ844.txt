Title: Epic Zebra Fight For Mate | Africa | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHuqeIP3_HQ


A lone Grévy's zebra.
He weighs close to half a ton...
and could go for three days
without drinking.
Like the macaques,
his forebears were refugees
from the advancing Sahara.
The land is scrubby and dry.
But this stallion has claimed it
as his own.
He's been waiting months for visitors...
female visitors.
If they like his territory,
they might stay a while.
It's his first chance to mate
for a very long time.
Hardly a success.
Perhaps his visitors are looking
for a more impressive partner.
There's another setback.
The females were being followed...
a posse of young males.
every one a rival.
It's time to separate
the men from the boys.
One by one, the stallion sees them off.
The females had ringside seats.
And his prowess has not gone unnoted.
Machismo gives way to tenderness.
Around here,
you have to take every opportunity...
be it for food, for water, or for mates.
Female Grévy's are a fickle bunch.
The herd have decided to move on...
all of them.
The stallion may never see them again.
But there's a chance
that one is now carrying his foal.
