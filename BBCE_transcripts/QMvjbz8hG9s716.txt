Brown trout were first introduced
to these pristine rivers for sport..
in the late 1800s.
With little competition and few predators,
they grew to enormous proportions.
Today New Zealand's trout
can reach lengths of almost a metre...
and weigh up to five kilos.
These prize fish
have monstrous appetites...
and surprisingly bloodthirsty tastes.
So, some fly fishermen opt for something
a little more substantial.
Here, the insect imitations have been
replaced with fluffy imitation...
mice.
House mice first arrived in New Zealand
as stowaways on European boats.
This youngster
is looking for his next meal.
But first he'll have to run a gauntlet.
For mouse or man,
opportunities come to those who take them.
New Zealand is a modern paradise
for newcomers from around the world.
