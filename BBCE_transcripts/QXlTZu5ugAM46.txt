[Music]
in the forests of senegal
spy bush baby is part of a team of spy
cameras capturing
intimate views of our closest living
relatives
here the family lives a charmed
existence
parental love and friendships form the
foundation of their society
spy tortoise is also being deployed
but these are highly perceptive animals
something's not quite right
this five-year-old checks what the
others are thinking
they seem equally baffled
but with his curiosity peaked he simply
can't stay away
as his interest grows so does the
strength of his feelings
he just has to have spy tortoise all to
himself
he hides with it in his leafy day bed
where he'd normally take a nap
but he's too excited to sleep
he's torn between using it as a pillow
and giving it a cuddle
it's somewhere between a toy and a pet
it's definitely not for sharing
um
chimps don't normally have possessions
but spy tortoise has stirred new
emotions
chimpanzees five males
in silence they move on the forest floor
listening for their prey
this is what they're after callabas
monkeys
feeding in the canopy 30 meters up to
catch them
these chimps have learned to hunt in the
most extraordinary way
stealthily the chimps take up position
underneath their quarry
callabas are light and agile so they can
move in the thinnest of branches
the heavy chimp hasn't a hope alone
but this is a team and each has left his
own specific role
the driver the blockers
and the most experienced hunter the
ambusher
working together they have a chance
the driver makes the first move
a young chimp quite new to hunting his
objective is simple
to climb up beneath the monkeys and
flush them out
the team watches from below poised for
action
the hunt is on the chimps on the ground
immediately run ahead of the columbus
the blockers are first in place they
anticipate where the callabas are
heading
and climb trees on either side
older more experienced than the driver
they must make themselves conspicuous
ready to funnel the callabas between
them
meanwhile back on the ground the
smartest chimp the ambusher is on the
move
his objective to get even further ahead
he has seen the blockers go up and works
out where the columbus will be funneled
he picks a strategic tree
he hides and waits
the trap is now set
the driver pushes the columbus on
they begin to scatter but three seem to
be heading straight into the trap
a gap in the canopy the columbus are now
getting away
the heavy blockers can't leap across
they must climb down in a last effort to
reform the trap
[Music]
and back up again
now the blockers are back on course
[Music]
another leap right into the ambusher's
tree
the trap has sprung the ambusher grabs
he misses the collapse turns
straight into the hands of a blocker
it's over
for the chimps this is the triumph of
generations of learning
but you can't learn to hunt if it's not
in your nature
for all predators the story starts with
the same basic thing
instinct killing
suddenly distant calls unsettle the
chimps
they look to their leader nick for
[Music]
support
[Music]
[Applause]
what's happened the reason that they're
so freaked out is that they've heard
calls of the neighboring community so
that means that their neighbors might be
actually
encroaching on their territory and now i
think what they're going to do is
they're going to move in that direction
try and see off the other community
they all go and embrace nick
they're frightened they've heard
distinct calls
that's asking for reassurance here he
comes
and he has got all his hair now erected
it's called piler erect and that is just
when he's showing that he's really
the boss this is the time
when all internal politics and rivalries
are completely forgotten and its
total solidarity against the community
once again the rival community's called
echo through the forest
if nick is ever going to step up to his
alpha role
he needs to do it now and he doesn't
disappoint
in an effort to push the rivals away
nick rallies the santo
into a deafening chorus i can't
distinguish anymore what's our chance
what's your neighboring chimp
so quickly
[Applause]
then as suddenly as it started it's over
the rival communities backed off the
sanso chimps
will hold on to their dwindling
territory for another day
these males are the troop leaders
they hold all the power here
[Music]
joining them is every young male's
ambition
to be accepted into this elite is the
path to privilege
but it's a dangerous journey
the youngster decides to follow
at first he has enough sense to keep his
distance
these males are twice his size
the low-ranking chimps retreat before
the troop leaders
arrive at the waterhole
[Music]
dominant males have a highly stressful
life as they constantly squabble to
protect their position
the youngster can't take his eyes off
them
this is his chance to get himself
noticed
if he can impress even one of the big
males for the show of strength
he might just be accepted into their
ranks
his best attempt at a macho display has
certainly caught their attention
but they are not impressed
in fact this drumming means they're
getting rather angry
[Applause]
the youngster is not quick enough
he gets a short sharp lesson about how
hard it can be
to break into this close-knit gang
he's lucky to escape with just an
injured hand
for the moment he's neither big enough
nor strong enough
to be taken seriously by the troop
leaders
without status he will never enjoy the
privileges of the best food
or the attention of females
pansy the chimps extraordinary skills
with human language
have led researchers to explore the
little-known world of chimpanzee
communication
at twycross zoo primatologist dr katya
liebel
is investigating the methods of
communication chimps use amongst
themselves
although chimps can't speak they use a
range of gestures and facial expressions
as a way of communicating gems don't
need
language in their environment because
they have a very complex
communicative system based on non-verbal
communication
by observing many different groups of
chimpanzees
catcher hopes to compile the world's
first chimp dictionary
the twycross chimps are a useful group
to study there's an ongoing power
struggle
between the dominant male kip and a
young teenage challenger
named peter fights between the pair
are commonplace
the tension is producing a rich and
varied array
of chimp communication across the whole
group
the first gesture noticed by catcher
comes as a direct result of the fight
peter is spotted making a facial
expression that signifies
fear
the corners of the mouth are really
withdrawn and you can see the teeth
we also do this when they scream so it
can be slightly open
[Music]
chimps also have a facial expression for
playfulness
the mouth is open and the teeth are
still covered with the lips
would be like this so this would be a
play face
in this interaction we can see kip and
william or chasing around and you can
see that it's a playful interaction
because william actually has a play face
chimps gestures can be far more subtle
than mere facial expressions
immediately after their fight peter taps
kip lightly on the shoulder
it's chimp for saying sorry the
individual that lost the fight
will approach the more dominant one and
will extend its arm
to ask for reconciliation so this is an
expression of submissive behavior
the chimps also show such communications
as displaying which means
i'm the boss
pouting which means give me some food
please
grooming which means i am your friend
and supporter
pretending to bite means i'm enjoying
this play fight
all of these behaviors reinforce social
bonds
communicate feelings and establish who
is in charge of the group
they even perform actions that seem all
too human
[Music]
but while chimps across the world only
have a limited repertoire of
vocalizations
they constantly invent and share new
gestures with each other
one theory basically is that they
imitate gestures
from each other they learn their
gestures by interacting with others
the theory that chimps imitate each
other's gestures
has led some primatologists to believe
that this behavior may have also been
present
in the ancient ancestors of humans and
may have led to the languages
that we all use today
[Music]
[Applause]
