[Music]
Timbo was forced from his family when
his boisterous ninja was getting out and
yeah it's just what's required a chance
to test his strength and find his place
in lists bachelorhood
for now he's right at the bottom there's
always a bigger elephant
[Music]
fights between old Tuskers of Tears
[Music]
the winning ball has seen the new
arrival Timbo isn't so confident now the
Tosca will decide if Tambor belongs
it could be crushed with just one blow
but there's no real aggression here
[Music]
Tembo has been accepted
[Music]
he may be the lowest in the pecking
order but he's a step closer to
fulfilling his destiny
[Music]
you
