This is one of them.
From the purposeful way
in which he's walking,
it's clear that the search for prey
has started.
The other members of the team
aren't far away.
They've been steadily following
the monkeys for about 20 minutes,
looking for an opportunity.
The technique they'll amost certainly use
is that one of them will be driving
the colobus ahead of him,
then there will be others
that go up on either side
who are the blockers, who won't make
any attempt to catch the monkeys.
And then there are pacers who go
and grab at the monkey if they can.
And finally there's one male
who will go up ahead
and ambush it,
so bringing the whole trap closed.
The monkeys are now getting alarmed.
A driver is going up to prevent the group
from settling
and to drive them towards an area
where they're more easily trapped
That's one of the blockers that has now
quietly come ahead of the colobus
and he's halfway up the tree now.
He's deliberately making himself
conspicuous.
Now it looks like they're all in position.
The drivers have gone up,
the blockers have gone up.
And now the one who's going to make
the ambush and close the ring,
he's gone up too.
The colobus will be very lucky
if they escape now.
They've got one!
The hunters are tearing it apart.
Everyone, the hunters of the trees
and the spectators on the ground,
are screaming with excitement.
Now the kill is brought down,
so that the females and others
can share it.
And there's a reward for that long chase,
the divided body of a colobus monkey.
These blood-stained faces
may well horrify us,
but we might also see in them the face
of our long distant hunting ancestors.
And if we are appalled by that
mob-violence bloodlust,
we might also see in that too, perhaps,
the origins of the teamwork
that have in the end, brought human beings
many of their greatest triumphs.
