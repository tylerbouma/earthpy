Title: Dinosaur Cannibalism | Planet Dinosaur | BBC

A carcass will attract
every big predator for miles around.
A male Majungasaurus,
attracted to the feast.
It is more than capable
of challenging for the carcass.
Majungasaurus has short arms
and can't grasp.
Like Tyrannosaurs,
it's all about the bite.
The shape of Majungasaurus' skull
and teeth
suggests a very different biting style
to the flesh-tearing dinosaurs.
With a broad, short and muscular skull...
it was a dino
better adapted to biting and gripping,
rather than slashing its prey.
This fight is about more than just winning
the feeding rights to a carcass.
When the bite marks
on the mauled Majungasaurus remains
were studied more closely...
the marks on the bones were found to match
the only large carnivore in the region.
There is no bigger killer
in these lands than Majungasaurus.
This is the first, irrefutable evidence
of dinosaur cannibalism.
It might seem shocking,
but it's a behaviour that clearly shows
the most successful killers will exploit
any situation to their maximum advantage.
