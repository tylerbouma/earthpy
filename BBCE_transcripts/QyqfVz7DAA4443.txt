even parts of the open sea like this Bay
in the West Indies at certain times
become so thick with fish that they can
support great flocks of fishing
Barracuda among the most ferocious
hunters in the sea and they regularly
drive shoals of small fish into the bay
[Music]
the pelicans can tackle the shoals even
when there are foot or two beneath the
surface
[Music]
but a pelican can only swallow the fish
it's cooped up in its baggy bill if it
lets the water drain out first to do
that it must open it B+ slightly and
that is the moment the gulls are waiting
for
[Music]
