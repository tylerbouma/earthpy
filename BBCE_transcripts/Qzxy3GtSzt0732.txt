Title: Great White Shark Attack And Breach | Planet Earth | BBC Earth

The great white...
the largest predatory fish on the planet.
Each dawn, Cape fur seals
leave their colony to go fishing.
To reach the open sea,
they must cross a narrow strip of water...
and that is patrolled by great whites.
Each seal is indeed swimming for its life.
The shark relies on surprise.
The great white's turn-of-speed
is powered by a high metabolism.
They only thrive in cold temperate seas,
for only these waters
contain sufficient food necessary
to fuel such a ravenous predator.
