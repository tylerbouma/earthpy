in fact when a person steps down from a
Jeep they won't come towards you the
moment they hear your footsteps they
tend to run away into the bush and I
really never had a manager for leopards
humans would be such easy prey

is remarkable that most of them stick to
eating livestock
it seems to me that in India an ancient
and balanced relationship exists between
humans and lipids and that to upset this
relationship something definite has to
change
