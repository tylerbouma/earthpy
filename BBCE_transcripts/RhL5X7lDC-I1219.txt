Hey, that looks strange.
It's like wobbly grass and it's in a hole.
Look at those little birds tippy-toeing
on the funny grass.
That looks like a lot of fun.
They've got very bendy legs.
It is grass isn't it?
It must be, those birds are walking on it.
Stay there little birds,
I'm coming to play.
Here goes, another jump to practise.
Ew, water!
It looks nothing like water.
Uh oh, there's a big hipp... hipp...
hippopotamus over there.
I don't think he wanted me
to jump in his bath.
Is he still behind me?
Is someone looking out?
Oh, quick get me out of here.
Oh, just a bit more.
Somebody help me. Please.
Oh, I can't believe I'm soaking wet again.
Twice in one day.
Why is it always me?
Oh, Kali.
His mama thinks he's had enough
of an adventure for one day.
It's time for them all to head home.
But they have to go back
the same way they came.
Which means Kali will have to
jump the stream one more time.
