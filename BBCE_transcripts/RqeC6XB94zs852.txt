Title: Elephant Mother Faces Horrible Decision |  Africa | BBC Earth

With the grass gone, all the elephants can
scratch from the dust is withered twigs.
The adults might just survive on this...
but it will not support a calf for long.
Every mother in the herd is struggling
to provide milk for her calf.
The search for food
is increasingly urgent.
As the herd moves on,
this female faces a terrible choice.
To carry on with her family
or stay behind with her calf,
who's becoming too weak to even stand.
They will soon be out of sight.
But her instinct is to stay.
She won't abandon her baby.
With the calf's last breath,
she knows that her battle is lost.
