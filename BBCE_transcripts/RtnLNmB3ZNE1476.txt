Herbivores have
powerfully muscled hind legs
that give them superlative acceleration,
Invaluable if you are caught unawares.
Once again, numbers bring safety.
The North American pronghorn is
the second fastest sprinter on the planet,
but over long distances
it's the world champion.
But all large herbivores
have to be able to run fast.
They run on tip-toe, so that they cover
more ground with each stride.
Muscles are bunched
at the top of the legs,
so that the limbs are streamlined.
Some grazers flaunt their athleticism,
as if to say:
"I'm fit, so save your energy
and pick on someone weaker."
Cheetahs may be the fastest sprinters,
but gazelles are better
at dodging and jinking.
Slimline legs, however,
trip only too easily.
And having eyes on the side of your head,
so that you can't see directly forward,
can be catastrophic.
Even so, herbivores manage
to outmanoeuvre their enemies
more often than you might suppose.
Kicking hooves and thrusting horns
are formidable weapons.
This mother is going to defend her fawn,
come what may.
A buffalo has incautiously
strayed away from its herd.
It surely can have no defence
against a group of lions.
But the rest of the herd have noticed.
Faced with the threat of hundreds of tons
of massed anger, the lioness turns tail.
The male lion, however,
seems unwilling to give up.
The buffalo, with their heavy armament,
have won this particular battle.
But the war on the plains
is a never-ending one.
