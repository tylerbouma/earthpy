the team has high expectations of Yap
they've come here hoping to find a fish
that's wider than a bus before any
diving can take place the team must ask
the local chief for permission therefore
also have with us a group of scientists
that are looking at very deep water fish
all through micronesia they're very
interested and yep with no ancient
written language the people of Yap used
chants and dances to pass the history on
through the generations permission
granted with the formalities over
tomorrow the real work can begin
