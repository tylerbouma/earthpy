Senegal West Africa
how do a remarkable troupe of
chimpanzees
it gets so hot and dry here it's the
very limit of where they can survive
[Music]
this territory is ruled by one strong
and determined leader
and now for male known as David
his rule gets him the best of everything
but he can trust no one
he's surrounded by rivals prepared to
kill him for his crown this is a story
of power politics and the fight for
survival
[Music]
