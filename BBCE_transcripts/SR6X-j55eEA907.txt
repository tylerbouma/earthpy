It's now four o'clock in the afternoon
and Kaitlyn has been in labour,
on and off, for the last five hours.
We've just finished a period
where there was a couple of hours
of not really much activity.
She's just getting to the point now
where she's having some pretty regular
and strong contractions.
Kaitlyn is entering
the advanced stages of labour.
Good girl, well done.
Copy.
Copy. So, when she has a contraction,
it's starting to emerge.
Good stuff! Don't touch it!
This is the amniotic sac,
which means there is a cub on the way.
The cub in the sac just burst around it.
Now we can see a face.
Here we go, mate.
Come on, lick it.
Lick it. Lick it. Lick it. Lick it.
Come on.
The sensation of Kaitlyn's licking should
trigger the cub's lungs to start working.
Giles, is she licking it?
-Yeah, she is now.
-Yeah, okay.
It's gasped three times,
but it's not breathing properly yet.
Copy, Giles.
Her licking it will
stimulate it to breathe.
Yeah.
I still feel like we should get in there
and give her a hand.
Copy, Giles. Leave, please leave.
She's licking its face.
It needs to clear
whatever liquid is in the mouth.
So, that is just leave her be
for the moment.
It's been two minutes and although
the cub's made some weak attempts,
it still hasn't started
breathing properly.
-Yeah.
-A big gasp.
It's gasping, but it's not breathing.
Okay, it's breathing.
Well, that's two, three breaths, four.
Good girl! You did so well.
She did very well. There we go.
See? She knows what to do.
-This is awesome.
-Yeah.
So, the cub just made its first ever
noise, a little squeal-out to Mum.
Mum looked surprised if anything.
He's a beautiful ten-minute-old cub.
That's incredible, isn't it?
Man, my heart was in my mouth.
There's a good girl.
For a first-time mum
she's doing an amazing job
and it's really hard just to sit back here
and let her get on with it.
She's starting to have contractions
in preparation for the second one
to arrive.
There's the sac you can see coming out.
Well done. Good girl.
-Number two!
-Doing so well.
-Good girl! Well done.
-There we go.
Good girl.
This one's come out kicking and screaming.
Good girl.
It's absolutely amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
It's two males and Kaitlyn's allowing
Giles to share in the moment.
One's up and about.
You're so good. You're so amazing.
Good girl.
