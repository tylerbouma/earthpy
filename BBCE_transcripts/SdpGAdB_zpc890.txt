Title: Ants Battle to Protect Their Fortress | Life Story | BBC Earth

Back in the Australian rainforest,
this weaver ant fortress
sits at the heart of a rich territory.
Hunting parties go out to gather food
to fuel their growing numbers.
Some canopy caterpillars are not killed,
but farmed by the ants.
They exude a sugary secretion
that the ants collect.
In return, the ants mount a guard
to protect the caterpillar
wherever it goes.
But a successful colony
inevitably attracts enemies.
This jumping spider's body shape...
resembles that of an ant.
A disguise good enough
to fool these nursery guards.
It's after one of the colony's
most valuable assets...
the grubs.
In a colony numbering tens of thousands,
a single grub is an insignificant loss.
But the rich territory
of a successful colony
draws more destructive enemies.
Raiders from
a neighbouring weaver ant colony,
looking to expand their own empire.
Invaders are quickly spotted.
The guard releases pheromones
to alert the rest of the colony.
They stream out of the nest
to defend their home.
If the home defences fail...
the colony will be wiped out.
Some of the defenders
deploy their most potent weapon.
They squirt formic acid.
The stinging liquid
halts the invaders in their tracks.
And now the home guard
can go on the offensive.
Home and territory are secure once again.
A colony may lose many workers
in defence of its home.
But their sacrifice
helps safeguard the next generation.
