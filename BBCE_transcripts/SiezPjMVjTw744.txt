[Music]
for many this is their first journey
across the Himalayas for some it will be
their most
Golden Eagles have been expecting them
[Music]
[Music]
the Eagles work in pairs to separate a
young crane from the flock
[Music]
[Music]
it escapes the touches of one and is
caught by another
but even a young crane is a heavy prize
and the Eagle has to struggle to control
it
[Music]
the mother can wait no longer
this is a desperate race against
worsening weather
the rest of the flock battle on
[Music]
