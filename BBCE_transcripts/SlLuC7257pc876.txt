Title: Alligators Showing Off for Mating Season | Animal Super Senses | BBC Earth

Every spring, the male alligators
put on a spectacular mating display.
They sink down in the water,
so their backs are just below the surface
and make really low-frequency sounds.
And the consequence of that
is that water droplets on their back
look like they're dancing.
And it soon becomes a water dance-off...
as rival males compete
by displaying to females.
I've never really had any desire
to be close to a bellowing alligator,
but I do want to see this and, to do it,
I've got to trigger a chorus
of amorous alligators.
To see this spectacle,
Helen need to encourage
some alligators to start dancing.
And to do that, she needs to replicate
their infrasonic calls...
so they think
there's a larger male close by.
And that requires speakers
even bigger than a campervan.
These speakers produce sounds at 19 hertz,
the same deep frequency
as the alligators bellow at.
So, let's see if they can entice
a grumpy alligator to start flirting.
So that's it.
Those are the big infrasound speakers
sending sound out over the lake here
and now we just have to wait and see
if any of the alligators react.
Oh, straight over there,
tail up in the air, getting ready to call.
There are two parts to this display.
A deep bellow from their mouths.
It's like hearing dinosaurs.
And the water dance.
Although we can't hear it,
these alligators are actually
producing a very low-frequency hum.
And this causes water droplets
to bounce off their backs.
For these ancient predators,
this elaborate display is essential
for attracting mates
But how do they make the water dance
just using sound?
Footage from our high-speed camera
reveals their secret.
The alligator's back is just below
the surface of the water,
As it begins to bellow,
its entire body vibrates.
And its back acts like a piston,
driving the surface of the water
into a dramatic splashing display.
It's thought that alligators
have been calling like this
for at least 70 million years,
