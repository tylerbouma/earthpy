I joined Bobby as he went to remove
a problem gator,
and the word was it was a big one.
This gator had made its home in a canal
in the middle of a housing development.
There were pets and children everywhere.
There was no way the gator could stay.
With over a million gators in Florida,
relocation just isn't an option.
There's simply no safe place to put them.
Most have to be destroyed.
Gators can disappear completely
in just a few feet of murky water,
but Bobby has 20 years of experience
to call upon.
He can practically read the gator's mind.
This was a big gator.
A potential man-eater
and a very serious threat.
With everyone's safety in mind, Bobby
decided had to be put down there and then.
It was just too big and too dangerous.
But in the commotion I noticed Bobby
staggering to the back of the boat.
He'd been shot, hit by shrapnel.
You okay?
We got him, he's dead.
Fortunately it was just a small piece
of lead but it still made a nasty hole.
It's a sad fact, but as far as alligators
are concerned,
we humans do just about everything
to encourage trouble.
Have them as pets in our homes,
feed wild ones
and put housing developments in
the middle of where they naturally live.
Crocodilians kill and eat more people
than all the other man-eaters
in this programme put together.
Here in Florida, any alligator even posing
a threat to a human is removed.
I never like seeing healthy animals
put down.
But, when they threaten human lives
like this one,
often it's the only reasonable option.
The alligator is an instinctive
trigger-happy killer.
This one would have no qualms
about attacking your pet dog
or even a child.
Crocs and alligators are ultimate killers.
Trouble is sometimes they're just too good
for their own good.
