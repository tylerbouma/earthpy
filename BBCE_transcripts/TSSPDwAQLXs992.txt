This is going to be the end
of the road for a lot of salmon.
These bears are really hungry.
They haven't tasted salmon for ten months
and the big males battle
for the best fishing spots.
The longer the salmon take
over their journey upstream,
the weaker they become.
And these falls present them
with their biggest challenge yet.
Although the falls aren't very tall,
the bears hold the high ground.
The salmon make short exploratory leaps
to see where the bears are.
But they don't always get it right.
This mother bear has been waiting months
for this moment.
Competition is fierce
for these first salmon,
even between a mother and her own cubs.
More and more fish
arrive at the foot of the falls.
Eventually, they have to go for it,
regardless of the danger.
But numbers are on their side.
For every salmon that gets caught,
hundreds make it past the bears.
