one of the uk's most loved yet elusive
semi-aquatic creatures had all but
disappeared from the uk
in the 1970s but now
the future is looking a bit brighter for
this treasured mammal
wild otters underwent a disastrous and
sudden decline here in the uk
in the 1950s and 60s a species that
requires clean waterways to survive
the combined effect of habitat loss
pollution and pesticide use
decimated populations but now
they seem to be making a bit of a
comeback
[Music]
we've come to the uk wild otter trust
based in devon
to find out more about these mysterious
mammals
the trust rescues and rehabilitates
orphaned otter cubs
caring for them and continuing their
development so eventually
they can be released back into the wild
dave webb who founded the charity works
hands-on with the otters
every day and we wanted to find out more
about how
exactly you care for orphaned otter cubs
and just as we arrived we were welcomed
with a surprise
oh my god colwin is a 12 week old
orphan who was found wandering alone on
a road in mid wales
when otters are this small they will not
survive without their mothers
so he was picked up and bought to the
trust
for his first few days it was touch and
go
but thankfully he has now grown from
strength to strength
and is quite the little character
ensuring he is putting on enough weight
is a vital part of the rehabilitation
process
so daily weighing is all part of his
care and what's a healthy weight for
this age
so this one now probably about 900 to a
thousand grams
so when he stops drinking 1472.
he's just adorable and how long will you
have him here with you the whole process
is a year long and then when he reaches
about 12
1300 grams you'll then go back outside
to an outside pen
where then it's the next stage of rehab
so this part
is what mother would be doing in the
world so i'm making a fuss of him
pushing him around and letting him
feel his feet and then he'll go back
outside and then it'll be hands off you
won't have any fingers to nibble
the next stage of colwin's
rehabilitation will be hands off
from the team when he moves to his
outside enclosure
otters never lose their wild instincts
and as he gets older will become
more wary of humans and will give a
nasty bite
if he feels threatened despite being
hand raised in no time at all
he will become very wild
[Music]
orphans will stay with dave and the team
for around a year and will go through
different stages of rehabilitation
starting with hands-on enrichment then
to an outdoor pen
and finally into an enclosure with thick
scrub
so they can get used to hiding in the
undergrowth
as part of his development dave will
take him outside once a day
this is incredibly important to
strengthen his legs
being semi-aquatic otters are excellent
swimmers and are known for their stocky
muscles in the back legs
ensuring coleman starts to develop these
muscles
is crucial for his progression as he
becomes an adolescent otter
wild otters live in holes along
riverbanks called halts
and a halt will have a few different
entrances to protect against flooding
with at least one entrance being above
water level
in the wild coleman would stay in the
halt for around 10
weeks then with encouragement from his
mother
begin to learn how to swim but without
his mother around
dave has the task of teaching him with
swimming lessons taking place
in the bath
[Music]
we wanted to find out a bit more from
dave about the charity
and the threats that otters currently
face
as despite populations bouncing back the
species still requires conservation
efforts to fully recover
we focus on the rehabilitation of orphan
daughter cubs
we've currently got seven here all the
pens are designed
to bring them on from a really small age
so we've got the hospital in the corner
when they're first found was usually a
few weeks old and then we bring them up
through the system of pens
up until the last big pen which is big
really wild
and then we release them back to the
wild after a year and
on average how many cubs do you get
brought into you each year
usually it's one or two so it's not a
big big number
this year we've had seven and
potentially
it could have been 11 or 12.
sadly some of the ones that we collected
had either been poisoned or
were beyond help and we had to have them
put to sleep unfortunately but it's all
about the awareness really i mean
people are starting now to just know us
see us as an organization which really
helps
they're certainly becoming more active
during the day so
they've always been diurnal they're not
naturally nocturnal because
the awareness has been raised about
otters people are more prone to see them
if that makes sense
so it's all about getting the education
out raising the awareness about the
species
and we've seen with some of the care
that you do here is it's
quite hands-on but they are
wild animals aren't they yeah um when
they're small like
the cup we've got from mid wells they
need
to be handled because that's what the
mother would do but as we progress them
through this system here they become
less
and less reliant and friendly which is
exactly what we want you've seen earlier
today
the cub in that pen she's on the point
of release
so she's really often not really
interested in humans which is great
retreats when she's grabbed some food
and she's just wild so you've got to
respect them for the world
always keep that respect because if you
don't that's when you're going to get
bitten
and no one wants to get bitten um no not
not particularly um i've been bitten
three times by a small cub
um so it's not something i'd recommend
i can think of better pastimes exactly
[Music]
