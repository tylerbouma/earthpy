[Music]
I think it's one of the last place in
the world where you can see so many
sharks you know there are other place
where you see sharks but as many you
know reef shark and so many kinds
under-protected
[Music]
it says until if this place is protected
it can really tell the difference in the
reef this is what a pristine reef should
all shark are protected it's forbidden
to kill a shark to fish are and many
people are coming to dive in French
Polynesia because of sharks because it's
unique it's like the era touch for
future regeneration and we're going to
protect them
