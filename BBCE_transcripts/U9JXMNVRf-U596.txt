Title: Mother Lioness Hunts Warthog | BBC Earth

Mojo lacks the confidence
of his intrepid neighbours.
And not only that,
his energy levels are at an all-time low
It's been days since he last ate.
And, as the rainy season wears on,
food is scarcer than ever.
But Nyata is determined
and extremely patient.
She spends hours watching
and stalking potential prey.
She even memorizes every warthog den
on her patch.
Eventually her patience pays off.
Another warthog...
this time a huge male with deadly tusks.
She needs to get close before she attacks.
The bushes provide the perfect cover.
Mission accomplished.
Now she must protect her kill.
The boar is as big as she is
It takes all her strength
to drag it into cover.
It's slow and exhausting work
A hidden island is the perfect place
to defend her kill
She calls Mojo into feast.
After the meal, a rare opportunity
for mum and her cub to relax
