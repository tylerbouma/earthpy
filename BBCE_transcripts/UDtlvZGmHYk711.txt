Title: Spider With Three Super Powers | The Hunt | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDtlvZGmHYk


To help her in her quest,
she's equipped with three superpowers.
First, an amazing approach
to getting about.
Portia is a jumping spider...
able to leap up to 50 times
her own body length.
Nowhere seems beyond her reach.
Next, her second superpower,
superb eyesight...
essential if she is to distinguish
her prey in all this clutter.
Because her prey doesn't stray.
Portia is a spider-eating spider.
This raises a few problems.
Her lunch is three times her size...
packed with venom...
and surrounded by a sticky trap.
Mission impossible?
Not at all,
because of her third superpower.
Portia is a genius.
She can map her world
in three dimensions...
and formulate a plan of attack.
She can have an idea.
The web-builder is blind.
It won't have a clue that she's coming.
Right on target
and safely behind those fangs.
But a mind as active as Portia's
can always do with more brain food.
Here, there's no anchor point
for the abseil.
But Portia has another idea.
Instead of going to the spider...
she will bring the spider to her.
She plucks the strands
to imitate struggling prey...
drawing the spider in...
to its death.
