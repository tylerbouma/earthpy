[Music]
in the atacama desert
george has called in wildlife
camerawoman sophie darlington
her thermal camera will be able to
capture the vampire bats feeding
what we need to do to nail it is to see
them feeding
that's that would be extraordinary
that's it
george has tracked them to a sea lion
colony on the far side of the island
it could be a perfect source of blood
for the bats we're coming down here
it's gonna be absolutely awesome that
would be incredible sophie's night
vision cameras should provide the answer
well we're just waiting for the bats to
arrive we're
almost so any minute now
the vampires will be flying
soon after george and sophie arrive so
do the bats
flitting close to them attracted by
their body heat
what do you got what you got let's see
okay
there's a big bull and there's been a
bat flying around
completely harassing him oh yeah i can
see it yeah
this is unbelievable look at it it knew
it and there's one at the back there's
more than one
the bats are all over them all over them
they're following it look there's a
vampire back look
it's just following it up behind it
it's right on the back it's just
unbelievable so
they are feeding on sea lions
the bats employ a clever strategy when
attempting to feed on an animal many
times their size
they land close by and creep towards an
area of flesh
the creature will struggle to defend
they're attacking from the rear and the
sea line is
they're there and they keep turning
through the head up
and then the sea lion moves they just
keep following you and the poor sea
lions are being
harassed i mean they really are aware of
them look at him
george you know it dispels the the myth
of the you know the
set of animals having a quiet sleep at
night they're not
it's torment it's absolute torment
they must be exhausted in the morning
these bats
they're completely and utterly just
going for it
oh one's just been hit by that wave
i just can't believe what i'm saying
weighing 40 grams each bat can consume
half its own body weight of blood in a
single feed
lasting up to 20 minutes is that a hot
spot there
is that is that the hot spot that's
waiting we can see the wound
good grief we can see the wound
on the flipper
only the thermal camera can reveal this
extraordinary behavior
the bats are going into the rear end
because that's where it's hottest and
you can really see that in a thermal
camera they're very very bright
which means the blood's very close to
the surface so easy access for the bats
an easy meal i'd recommend
to see the wound at the heat signature
of the wound
left by a vampire bat on the flipper of
a sea lion
in pitch darkness that is just
that is truly awesome
it is the last of the team's mysteries
solved
no we know what's happening that's why
there's a permanent colony of vampire
bats here because there's a
permanent colony of big fat blood-filled
food bags for them
mature male fruit bats have territories
in the roosting trees
branches that they mark with scent and
defend against other males
the females decide where to roost and
who to mate with
the males are remarkably well endowed
each morning the male checks out all the
females roosting on his branch
courtship can be lengthy and intense
20 minutes of deep grooming licking the
female's nether parts with a long
roughened tongue
perhaps to arouse her or perhaps to
remove any rival male
sperm
mating is vigorous noisy and repetitive
that may have looked violent but the
female can always let go of the branch
and fly off if she's had enough
any insects around here are in big
trouble
the sound of their wings is just
phenomenal
i actually have to raise my voice to be
heard above the sound of these bats
wings
and there is a wind being driven out
from the hole
just purely from their flapping wings
there are
nine different species of bats living
inside this cave
and one of them feeds on nectar the rest
are all
insect feeding bats and
this is one of the greatest aggregations
that is
collections of predators that you will
see on the whole planet
this is one of the greatest spectacles i
have ever witnessed from nothing
to an eruption of bats this really is a
volcano of bats
that is extraordinary
to see them begin their nightly
pilgrimage we scramble to a higher
viewpoint
above the sinkhole we just quickly run
up
above the sinkhole just to catch the
last few rays of sunshine
illuminating this cloud of bats
just heading out almost like tendrils of
smoke
over the top of the forest it really is
one of the most beautiful sights i've
ever seen every single one of the bats
their wings are backlit by the sunshine
so you can see
these tiny little phantoms glowing
orange as they hover above the forest
and look at that now just heading across
the skyline
in just great long
smoky tubes
[Music]
it may seem crazy to be looking at
something so exquisite
and suggesting it as something that
should go on the deadly 60 but actually
in terms of scale we will never feature
anything that is such
an epic display of predatory behavior as
this ever on this series
fountains abbey in yorkshire is a good
place to watch hunting bats in action
including one of the most common
dorbanson's band also known as the
waterbot
old stone bridges are a favorite roost
the water bath chirps aren't exactly
subtle at 110 decibels
makes more racket than a road drill
but like us most of the insects it hunts
can't hear
ultrasound
as the bat homes in it squeaks speed up
[Music]
insects have been bat prey since the
dinosaurs were here
and some have got wise to the hunter's
tricks
this moth has ears tuned direct to bat
frequency
and lightning reactions to help it dodge
attack
[Music]
power diving is a common moth escape
technique
though crash landing in the water can
backfire
the dorbantons isn't called the water
bat for nothing
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
in the abbey gardens a very different
bat sets out to look for food
brown long-eared bats use a different
strategy for most bats
instead of shouting they whisper
this means they get fainter echoes back
so they need
massive ears to compensate
elongated bats ears are so sensitive
they can pick up wing vibrations from a
moth
perched on a leaf
another bug bites the dust dispatched by
bat technology
now we have been incredibly lucky we've
moved some of the vegetation out of the
way
and right above me i can see two
little tent making bats these are very
pretty bats indeed and if you're not a
fan of bats because they're
they're dark and mysterious creatures
these will probably put you back on the
right track
because where else in the world do you
actually see white bats
now that white isn't there to make them
endearing to us humans
it uh it's possibly to do with a trick
of light
that white reflects the green that comes
through the leaf
and makes them blend in perfectly
now this structure is actually quite
simple um it's a
leaf of a plant that's in the banana
family
known as a heliconium what the bats have
done is
nibbled either side of the main mid-rib
of this leaf
so the leaf is then folded almost like
canvas
over the ridge pole of a ridge tent and
it's folded under its own weight
to provide the perfect little encampment
for these bats
they've also it seems pop mutt relief
with little holes
all i can assume is that that allows
them to kind of grip
on with their claws while they hang
upside down
