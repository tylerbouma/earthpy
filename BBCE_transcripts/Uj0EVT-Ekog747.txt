Title: Snow Leopard Hunting | Planet Earth | BBC Earth

Markhor gather for their annual rut.
Males must fight for the right to breed,
but on these sheer cliffs,
any slip by either animal could be fatal.
A snow leopard,
the rarest of Himalayan animals.
It's a female returning to her lair.
These are the first intimate images
of snow leopard ever filmed in the wild.
She greets her one-year-old cub.
Her den is well chosen.
It has exceptional views
of the surrounding cliffs.
On these treacherous slopes,
no hunter other than the snow leopard
would have a chance
of catching such agile prey.
A female with young
makes an easier target.
Her large paws give an excellent grip
and that long tail helps her balance.
Silently she positions herself
above her prey.
