You've got park vehicles coming through.
You've got trucks loaded up with charcoal.
And that's why Chimanuka is just so tense
about crossing the road.
If it was just him, it'd be fine.
So, he's just waiting nervously
for a quiet time to cross
with his whole family.
I feel for him.
After 20 minutes,
we take matters into our own hands...
and Lambert stops the traffic.
Look at this! Oh, my gosh!
Now, there you go.
That's confidence for you.
With Chimanuka in charge,
the orphan Marhale is confident enough
to venture out.
Whoa! Oh, fantastic!
Oh, my gosh, look at this!
The whole family!
Mwira and his mother are almost the last
ones to break cover and scamper over.
Absolute confidence. Look!
With all the youngsters across safely...
Chimanuka can stop being the lollipop man.
The boss, showing... us
that despite there's a road
running through...
this is still his jungle.
I love it!
It's a great relief
to see the whole family
across the road in safety.
This area is more densely forested
than the sections we've been in before.
It's criss-crossed with gorilla trails.
So, there are clearly
other families around.
And Mugaruka's arrival
just adds to the numbers.
Here he comes.
Oh, my word! Right down on to the road.
Amazing. He didn't even...
I thought maybe he'd stop,
be a bit reluctant,
but across he came, metres from me.
To see him out in the open like this,
you see how big he is. Amazing!
