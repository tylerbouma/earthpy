Title: Spinosaurus Fishes for Prey | Planet Dinosaur | BBC Earth

Spinosaurus is a predator,
but one that hunts in water.
It's ichthyophagous, a fish-eater.
This is Onchopristis.
An eight-metre-long giant swordfish,
similar to those alive today.
The saw-like rostrum
is lined with lethal barbs
and is, in itself,
up to 2.5 metres in length.
It's thought they migrated
into freshwater rivers to breed,
where the young may be safer,
but the adults are exposed to new threats.
With their breeding season at its height,
these rivers are filled with Onchopristis.
It's the perfect hunting opportunity
for Spinosaurus.
Spinosaurus's conical teeth evolved
to grip prey rather than tear off flesh.
For that, it needs powerful arms
and claws.
With prey plentiful,
Spinosaurus can afford to be wasteful.
A fact which other dinosaurs
take full advantage of.
Rugops, an eight-metre carnivore.
Anywhere else, it might dominate.
But here it is dwarfed by Spinosaurus.
Spinosaurus is unique,
with long, narrow jaws
and nostrils set high on its head.
Its teeth were straight and conical.
They gave us a clue as to how it killed.
More evidence came in 2008,
when Spinosaurus' skull
was put through a CT scanner.
It revealed a curious pattern
of holes and sinuses in the snout
that looked just like those of crocodiles.
It's thought these contained
pressure sensors...
sensors that,
like a crocodile, can detect prey,
making it perfectly adapted
to hunting in water.
This discovery gives us our best evidence
of exactly how it hunted.
Able to hold its snout in the water
because of its high nostrils,
it can strike
without even seeing its prey.
