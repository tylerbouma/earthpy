Something has spooked Ava.
Ah, she's going in the wrong direction.
She might be giving us the slip,
unfortunately.
Around the corner comes another mother
with even bigger cubs.
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
Just... amazing to see.
Looking at our female over there
and we've got another three polar bears
right here, even closer.
Those are two healthy looking cubs.
They're really nice looking cubs,
big chunky things.
Or maybe it's just that I'm a lot closer
to them... I have been with the others.
Just an incredible place this.
Suddenly, we find ourselves
surrounded by polar bears.
Another single bear just there.
Gosh!
So, we've got Ava with her two cubs.
We've got the female
with the two cubs that wasn't tagged.
Plus we've got a young bear
just behind us here.
Plus we've got the fat female
over on the ice.
That's eight bears around us.
And this one is walking
towards you, Gordon.
We really have
to keep our radar going now.
-So, we've got eight bears around us.
-Yeah.
Okay, four of them
are quite small cubs, but...
But this one, I can't believe that, Jason.
She's just utterly unfazed.
So, she's definitely got the scent
of this young bear coming in here...
and Ava is coming around the back.
She's a bit more sceptical.
Polar Bear Central, Jason.
The density of polar bears here
is unbelievable...
but it just shows you how easy it would be
to slip up somewhere like this.
You're concentrating on this lovely scene
of mother and two cubs behind you,
and walking up over the ridge...
-Another single bear just there.
-...is another mother.
I'm getting the feeling
that this isn't a good situation.
We've got 13 bears in this one area,
which is incredible.
This is potentially very dangerous.
I'd be more concerned of the young bear
that doesn't have cubs
than the female with the cubs.
Right, this one's quite...
-Watch out.
-Okay, Gordon!
It's okay. Just start...
Let the scooter run.
All good fun.
Another day in the office, Gordon.
Incredible!
It is amazing to see
this many polar bears in one place.
It may be a vision of the future
as temperatures in the Arctic rise
and bears are forced to congregate
on the last of the sea ice.
Despite sharing the ice
with so many other bears,
Ava and her cubs are doing amazingly well.
For now they seem to be thriving.
