As well as catching the fish, it was going
to be my job to fit the tag, too.
Not only are they fast, marlin travel
mind-boggling distances as well.
One tagged in California, was recaptured
10,000 miles away in New Zealand.
But fishing for marlin
needs a lot of patience.
It's wait, wait, wait.
When a black marlin strikes, it can strip
line off the reel at 120 feet per second.
That's 80 miles an hour.
I'll just say that again,
80 miles an hour.
It's only by measuring how fast
the line comes off the reel
that scientists have been able to work out
the marlin's top speed
Down a bit, down a bit!
This fish is like a Formula One
racing car.
It's fantastically aerodynamic
to reduce drag,
with a sharp bill at the front
to slice through the water.
And a performance motor at the back,
in the shape of its huge
crescent-shaped tail.
Giving me a real fight.
Oh, yeah. That's incredible.
Down and wind, down and wind.
It's doing it again.
Oh! There we go.
It's biting now. That's a big fish.
-Dump it. Bring it up.
-Okay, stop.
-Halfway down?
-Yeah.
Watch yourself.
I had to get the tag in
as fast as possible,
so we could let the marlin off the hook.
It's huge!
Tag him. That's him tagged.
It's gone.
Tag him! Yeah.
With the tag safely in place,
it was time for Donovan
to release the marlin.
What an animal.
Who knows where this Formula One fish
might turn up next,
as it roams the oceans of the world.
See the size of its tail,
it's just incredible.
-Thank you, Donovan. Thank you, Ray.
-Good job.
I'm feeling it now, geez.
That really is muscle against muscle.
There's nothing more really
than just man against fish.
As far as anyone can tell,
the black marlin is the fastest fish
on earth.
