Title: Defending the ant nest from intruders | Ant Attack | BBC

A worker gingerly explores
the gaping hole,
and a scouting party lays a scent trail
for others to follow.
Activity increases.
An assault is on.
Other ants have found
the termites' foraging tunnels
and scramble inside.
The tunnels are narrow and not at all like
the open spaces driver ants prefer.
Termite soldiers with enormous jaws
and heads prepare to check the incursion.
A soldier termite confronts the invaders
with a threat display,
but it's not going
to impress a driver ant.
The ants penetrate deep into the nest,
and the residents intensify their warning.
First blood is to the termites.
The tunnel guards are in danger
of being overrun.
Deep in the bowels of the nest lives
the termite queen.
If she is killed,
the entire colony will die out.
She must be protected,
so termites start to isolate her
from the fighting
by building a wall of mud mixed with
saliva that will harden like concrete.
There's not much time.
The ants break through
the first line of defence.
The queen termite security wall is
almost complete.
She and the royal court are incarcerated
but safe.
Another wave of ants
advances unchallenged.
But the attack is not going to plan.
In the tunnels, the ants become embroiled
in one-to-one duels.
The jaw-to-jaw combat is at stalemate.
Ants and termites seem locked
in a lethal embrace.
The adversaries are well-matched.
The answer: pulling out.
