For kangaroos, the greatest challenges
come from within their own society.
For a male, there's only really
one key lesson to learn in his life.
To get to the top,
he must become a fighter.
The battles are so brutal that males
need years of training to prepare.
The effort is worth it,
because a champion fighter
wins privileged access to the females.
This meadow is a boot camp
for aspiring boxers.
Training starts as soon
as a youngster is out of the pouch.
Its mother is a handy opponent
for a young joey learning the basics.
But he's soon off in search
of more sparring partners.
The other grown-ups are not
so tolerant of this lightweight.
This male alone rules the meadow.
He stands eight feet tall,
his muscles hardened by years of sparring.
Today, a challenger for his title
has come forward.
Full-blown fights are so dangerous,
they're not entered into lightly.
But when two males square up,
it's time to clear the arena.
Anything goes in these power struggles.
Eye gouging is entirely within the rules.
So is kicking below the belt.
The dominant male's skill
is already telling.
The stakes are high.
They risk broken bones
and internal injuries.
Suddenly...
it's all over.
The champion has beaten off
the challenger, at least for now.
