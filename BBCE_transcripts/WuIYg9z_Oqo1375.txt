A baby elephant takes longer to produce
than any other mammal, almost two years.
And now the matriarch
is starting all over again.
But she's old, and this will probably
be her last chance to produce a baby.
She has to get it right. Her body has to.
Deep inside, hormones in her blood
have been stimulating her ovaries,
producing an egg.
When it reaches maturity,
her ovary wall ruptures,
and the single egg is guided
into her reproductive tract.
It's a tiny event,
but it changes her behaviour.
She needs a mate so she summons one,
using an ultra-low frequency call
that travels long distances.
Reaching eventually a large male.
He has his own need to reproduce.
And he also knows that females
don't stay fertile forever.
He has to find her before it's too late.
But he isn't the only male
who has heard the call.
And the competition
for the fertile egg begins.
He is driven by a flood
of male sex hormones.
He literally oozes
with the reproductive urge.
But not only has he had to fight his way
past other males.
When he reaches the herd,
the female seems to have lost interest.
But it's all part of the test
to make sure of all the males on offer,
he is the biggest, strongest,
and most persistent,
qualities she wants her calf to inherit.
The male is finally allowed to mate.
But the success does not mark
the end of the battle.
Another even more ruthless one
is just beginning.
Of the billions of sperm he releases,
only one is needed to fertilise the egg.
Inside of her reproductive tract,
the female's immune system
doesn't distinguish between sperm
and any other kind of foreign invader.
To patrolling white blood cells,
these sperm could be diseased bacteria.
And thousands are engulfed and destroyed.
But the fittest survive,
only to run into a protective cloud
that shrouds the egg
and causes some of the sperm
to explode prematurely.
Of the few that get through
the egg's covering layer,
only one makes it all the way.
Then bars all others.
The fertilised egg is still only a spark,
but the mix of male and female genes
it contains will be the blueprint
for the building of a new
and unique baby elephant.
