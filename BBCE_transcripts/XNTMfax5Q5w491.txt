Title: Underwater Ambush from Croccodile | BBC Earth

If undisturbed wildebeest can drink
eight litres in a single session.
As his confidence billings he is oblivious
to what lurks beneath the surface
The herd is bewildered.
Some have never seen a crocodile before.
Even as the full horror unfurls,
there is great confusion
about just what is going on.
And that was just the first attack.
Three hundred hungry crocodiles
live in the Grumeti River.
Wildebeest react differently to crocodiles
and other predators.
Even the adults seem unsure
of just how much danger they're in.
The calf's desire to quench his thirst
overcomes any fear he may have.
The crocodiles manoeuvre around them
with surprising ease.
They are intelligent hunters,
plotting their attack with precision.
A strike can happen at any time.
Despite the carnage,
the mother and calf survive.
They stampede back onto the plains.
For the baboons,
it's more like a spectator sport.
They might as well settle down.
A single croc can take some time
to overpower its victim.
But crocodiles are cooperative feeders.
They work together.
The death roll breaks the prey
into bite-sized chunks.
But aggression can spill over.
