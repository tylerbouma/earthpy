Lions will normally avoid
hunting in such heat.
But they're also opportunists.
The lions will need
to bring him down quickly,
before they overheat.
Even away from the herd,
a bull is a formidable opponent.
It could gore and kill a lion.
Close to overheating, they finally succeed
in bringing him to the ground.
But the massive bull is not giving up.
Against the odds, and the full weight
of the lions, he regains his feet.
And it is now that the tables turn.
The lions are exhausted.
After a 20-minute struggle,
only the bull has the energy
to finish the fight.
In such exposed and extreme conditions,
the challenge for predators
and their prey is at its most intense.
