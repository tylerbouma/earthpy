Sika deer live here year-round right now
they're gearing up for the most
important event in their calendar
this stag has built up a harem of
females
he can't hang about a harem in heat is a
magnet for other males
the dominant stag has no choice but to
go and meet his rival
it's the newcomer that's won he has the
pick of the females for now
but it won't be long before other stags
move in to challenge him many males are
so exhausted they just won't make it
through the winter but at least some
will leave a legacy the females are
pregnant they'll need all their
resilience to survive the lean months of
winter
