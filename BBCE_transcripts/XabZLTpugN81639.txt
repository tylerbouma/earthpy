it's not easy finding sure footing in
this boggy terrain the ever-changing
flow of water is always revealing new
pastures so animals need to keep moving
for lions this means keeping up with
their prey which is no easy task
Impala can take the water in their
stride but for lions like most cats it's
a real obstacle
Buffalo are a potential target for a
large pride of lions if only they could
reach them there's only one thing for us
now the tables are turned the buffalo
may have reached their grassy island but
so of the hunters
but water is now played to the lion's
advantage helping them to corral the
herd
