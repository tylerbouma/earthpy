Kept inside under observation is Min Min.
She is having a very difficult labour
and has taken a serious turn
for the worse.
Three days have gone by,
and she should have given birth by now.
The fact that she hasn't suggests
one thing:
Her baby is probably dead.
But Min Min is defying the odds.
Incredibly, she is pushing on.
To survive a three-day labour
is unheard of here,
and yet she is trying... hard.
And then a breakthrough.
Pandas are born tiny, pink, blind
and virtually bald.
Min Min has had a daughter.
Except for a marsupial like a kangaroo,
giant pandas give birth
to the smallest mammal babies
relative to mother size.
But for a usually tiny baby,
Min Min's is unusually large.
Large births are always difficult,
and it's little wonder.
At seven and a half ounces,
Min Min's baby is almost double
the average size of a newborn panda.
It's also a fighter.
Thrashing legs are testament to that.
