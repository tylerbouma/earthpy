Here's another good example of whales
outsmarting people in the Mediterranean.
On the receiving end
is another prized fishing industry.
Not herring this time,
but giant bluefin tuna.
A fish as big as this will net the crew
at least $2,000.
The boats are following a long tradition.
Every summer after spawning,
bluefin tuna migrate
from the Mediterranean
to the Atlantic Ocean.
Each year the fishermen are waiting
and so are the killer whales.
Concrete blocks take the bait
down to 200 metres,
because tuna swim very deep
as well as fast.
With the line paid out the crew can only
wait and hope and watch the whales.
A fish has been hooked.
The sound of the winch is a signal
to the waiting whales.
The fishermen will have to work
as fast as possible to bring in the line.
The whales simply bide their time.
By the time the fish nears the boat
all the fight has gone out of it.
This is as easy a meal as a killer whale
could hope for.
Whales can strip the tuna in minutes.
All that remains for the fishermen
are leftovers.
This piracy on the high seas
doesn't do much for the whales' popularity
but this is just too good an opportunity
for them to miss.
These killer whales began stealing fish
in this way around 30 years ago.
Now the culture has spread among
all the members of two local pods.
The fishing boats don't stand a chance
