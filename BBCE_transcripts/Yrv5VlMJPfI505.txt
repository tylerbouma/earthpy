Title: Emperor Penguin Mourns the Death of Chick | BBC Earth

At first, penguins with chicks
circulate on the outside,
avoiding the pressure within.
As the weather worsens, they'll all have
to look for a place to tuck in.
Eventually, a huge huddle forms.
While those in the centre
are warm and protected,
those on the outside are still struggling.
To share the heat around, the penguins
take tiny steps to change position.
Waves of movement
ripple through the huddle,
giving everyone a chance
to have a go in the centre.
The huddle is so efficient, penguins
in the inner core can even overheat.
As these penguins try to cool down,
the colony starts to break up.
The collapse acts as a release valve,
shedding excess heat.
But it's dangerous for the chick.
As everyone moves position,
some mothers topple in the crush.
She tries to stop her full weight
falling on her chick.
Getting back up is especially difficult,
with a chick nestled in her pouch.
Her care finally pays off.
She and her chick rejoin the huddle,
as it starts to reform.
Not all have been so lucky.
This penguin has been searching
for her lost chick.
She hopes it might still be alive.
Her pouch is the only lifesaver she knows.
A female companion shows her concern.
The mother invested everything
into her chick.
To lose it is a tragedy.
She will have to wait another year.
