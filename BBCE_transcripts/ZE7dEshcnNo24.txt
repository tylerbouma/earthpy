i'm dan o'neill
a biologist and filmmaker and i'm on a
mission to find out what it takes to
save an endangered species
[Music]
join me on an expedition to the
mountains of kyrgyzstan
as i learned firsthand how this country
has brought snow leopards back from the
brick
work
we start our mission in bishkek
kyrgyzstan's capital
where i hope to meet some of the people
who've been dedicating their lives to
saving an animal that's almost
invisible it's like a ghost of the
mountains
i think it's the phantom who's there but
you never see it
after the fall of the soviet union in
1991
the economy in kyrgyzstan collapsed with
rural areas being particularly hard hit
snow leopards which only live in these
remote asian mountains
had a price on their heads their skin
and bones were traded on the black
market
and numbers fell dramatically by as much
as 80 percent
and despite global efforts the black
market for exotic pets trophy hunting
skins and organs is ominous
they're losing their habitats to farming
urbanization and climate change
but here in kyrgyzstan the snow leopards
are back
and this isolated country now has the
highest density of snow leopards
anywhere in the world
and i'm intrigued to find out why
they're doing so well
dr kustap sharma has brought me just 25
minutes
outside of the capital to the foothills
of the huge
tianshen mountain range what's special
about this place that you've taken us
not so long ago we were able to detect a
good population a healthy population of
snow leopards
in these mountains uh people have always
known there are snow leopards here
but uh it was on only three years ago
that we started to for the first time
photograph them using camera traps
that's what makes these mountains
special these snow leopards they oversee
the city of bishkek and bishkek lives in
the shadow of the snow leopards
that inhabit these mountains here so
why do we use the camera traps we
basically don't know how many smaller
puts there are
right and the camera traps are our eyes
in the mountains which help us
count how many smaller puts there are
and they don't complain when they're out
in the mountains
if i go and sit there for 20 minutes
i'll start complaining but these camera
traps stay there for six months without
complaining
and they record very valuable
information
what will we be doing to help you guys
you'll be helping set out
anywhere between 35 to 40 cameras
in an entire 7 800
square kilometer landscape what we hope
to do is once that data comes back
we will be able to individually identify
different snow leopards and put that
data into sophisticated algorithms
to estimate how many snow lips are there
in that landscape
gathering data on snow leopards in the
wild is one thing
but custard wants to show me the harsh
reality of what happens in this region
when snow leopards come into direct
conflict with humans
we are currently on our way to meet a
woman called saltinet
who runs a rescue and rehabilitation
center for injured animals here in the
capital city
and she has a very special individual
that's been rescued from
quite a traumatic experience that we're
going to meet today
hello hi my name is matt nice to meet
you saturn i'm dan
welcome thank you oh hello look at this
guy
you are very sweet aren't you
oh wow he doesn't see
mm-hmm stunning could you tell me his
story
uh vienna
[Music]
previously
[Music]
[Music]
it's a very sad story yeah it's very
sad what selfnet thinks is that he
was probably kept illegally as a cop may
be found
picked up
and then one day escaped well the fact
that
he was potentially an escaped car meant
that he wasn't afraid of people
and he came really close to someone who
had a gun and they were surprised
and they shot him in the face
it was the most painful image i've ever
seen there must have been
nothing less than a hundred pellets in
its head the pain that this knowledge
must be going through
and the agony that it must be going
through
it still sends shivers through your
spine
of course it's it's a classic case of
exotic
pet trade or the illegal demand for
snow leopards and other wild animals as
exotic pets and that's
disturbing truly disturbing and it's
[Music]
but if it was a wild snow leopard which
came into
a community and someone got spooked and
injured the cat even then that issue
needs to be
addressed through education and working
with the local communities
whether this was a wild snow leopard
trying to hunt where people now farm
or an escaped captive bred animal for
the pet trade
this cat's story is stark evidence of
the challenge they're facing
and the need to work with the
communities who share their lands with
snow leopards
outside of the capital the kyrgyz people
are spread across towns and villages in
thousands of square miles of remote
mountain ranges
where do you even start
i'm going to the top and managed to
arrange a meeting with one of the
governors
in charge of snow leopard conservation
he tells me they work with local people
who revere the snow leopard
to understand what happens when people
and snow leopards share an environment
they found for example that when snow
leopards have come into villages
they're often old or unable to hunt in
the hills
so education and understanding snow
leopard behavior is vital
nationally he tells me that eco-tourism
is a big hope for their economic growth
the fines for poaching have increased by
20 times and they plan to increase the
range of their national parks by around
40 percent
i listened as the governor explained
that the bishkek declaration was signed
by the 12 countries where snow leopards
live
and sets out their joint aims to protect
them and their habitats
thank you so much for your time
it's really nice to meet you hearing the
governor talk about how they're working
both locally and globally to protect
their snow leopards
is so reassuring and it's clearly
working
but policies alone don't save species
i need to see what this means on the
ground
[Music]
next time i meet the man in charge of
the snow leopard foundation in
kyrgyzstan
and we prepare for an expedition into
the remote sarichat reserve
to gather vital camera trap footage
[Music]
you
