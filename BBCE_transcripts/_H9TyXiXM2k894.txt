So, that is how it should be done.
Junior returns to his own bower
and tries to improve things.
That should probably go just here.
Or maybe here.
Perhaps he was right in the first place.
He just can't make up his mind.
This could take some time.
And it's not just about building.
The master's bower has something
that Junior's lacks completely.
Blue decorations really please a female.
And the master has gone to town.
Junior takes a closer look.
What will the master make of his visitor?
Rather than drive him away,
the master has other intentions...
Seduction.
Juvenile males
are almost identical to females.
So, the master grabs the opportunity
to practise his courtship display on him.
Junior doesn't know what to do next.
So, he exits...
mid-performance.
The youngster's bower.
With the breeding season close,
adult males grow
increasingly intolerant of juveniles.
Oh, dear, there's virtually nothing left.
Junior will just have to start
all over again.
