As the cubs have become bolder at home,
Giles thinks it's time for Spot and Stripe
to increase their socialization
with the adult tigers back at the zoo.
At the main tiger compound,
Giles and his team are full-time carers
for ten adult tigers
and Spot and Stripe
have been gradually exposed to them.
Ah, good boy! Good boy!
Good boy!
Seeing the adult tigers
through the glass is one thing,
but their next big milestone
is to socialize
and meet one of the adults
in the open air.
There's going to be lots of interesting
smells in here with all the other tigers,
like the big guys come through here
on a regular basis
and it's much, much more
of a sensory stimulation
for them in here, in terms of the smell
than just being round the front
of the glass
The big tigers never go round that side,
so...
Get used to walking around here boys.
In just over a month,
the cubs will be too big to live at home.
And they need to be accepted by the adults
for them to live here full-time.
He's a little bit nervous, as you expect.
You can see
he's smelling all the smells around.
There's lots of smells of big predators,
other tigers around,
so you got to be
a little bit cautious, naturally.
In the wild, an unrelated tiger
could easily injure the cubs.
-How is she?
-She's waiting. Here you go.
And Giles hopes Maneki won't display
any threatening behaviours.
So, this is Maneki.
Well, this is the very, very first time
that Maneki's seen any cubs whatsoever.
Tigers communicate
using a range of vocalizations.
And the most common non-threatening sound
they make is called a chuff.
Chuffing is reassuring.
So, they're chuffing at her.
They're chuffing at each other.
So, it's a reassuring type of noise,
but it's also a way of greeting.
So, she speaks your language,
not like Ruby.
Tigers are one of the few cats
in the world to communicate in this way.
These guys are very inquisitive,
so their facial expression with their ears
is exactly that.
Now he's being a bit submissive
for the fact
that he's putting his ears slightly back.
He's getting down low.
So, that's just being a little bit unsure,
if you like, whereas Maneki,
you can see how relaxed she is.
She's sat there. She's fairly happy.
So, Stripe,
he's getting a little bit close.
He's being cautious
in the way in which he approaches.
Good boy.
You're brave. Yeah.
Look at his face.
He's very, very cautious,
like he wants to go up a bit closer,
but he's also a little nervous,
but that's to be expected.
Like, look at the size of her
in comparison to him...
And she's reacting a little.
she doesn't want to be surprised.
The cubs have won over Maneki
and Giles is relieved.
For a very first encounter,
you couldn't have asked for it
to go any better or any smoother.
No one's being aggressive.
No one's showing over interest,
or too much interest,
and the cubs are coping really well.
