Title: Rare Tiger vs Boar Fight | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ibq2xaSpWk


To see a tiger hunting boar
is extremely rare.
To capture it on camera
is virtually impossible.
But Bagani takes me by surprise.
I'm worried. She's taking a terrible risk.
But as I watch, I see a new Bhagani,
a changed tiger.
This one is the master hunter I knew
at Ranthambore.
She carefully moves her tail
round the grass stems
to ensure she makes no noise.
Surely, nothing can stop her now.
The fact that Bhagani leaves her kill
shows her confidence.
There is no one who would dare take it.
This really is her territory now.
