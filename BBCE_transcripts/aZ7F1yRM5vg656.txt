Title: Mirror Mirror: Gorillas React To Their Reflection | Gorilla Family and Me | BBC Earth

But no one has carried out this experiment
with Grauer's gorillas in the wild.
Will they see this and run a mile?
Will they see this
and want to investigate it?
What will they make of it?
That's what I want to find out.
I've disinfected everything to ensure
there's no health risk to the gorillas.
And the mirror is Perspex,
so it can't shatter if handled.
Okay.
There's a cluster of gorillas down there
and it may well be
they might come up this slope,
so, I'm just going
to see if I can install it down there.
The mirror quickly attracts the attention
of two young gorillas.
Oh, gosh, straightaway.
One of the juveniles
has come straight up to it.
Not a worry in the world.
Some animals are surprised
when they see their own reflection
and react aggressively.
So, it's interesting to see that these
gorillas are so calm and inquisitive.
There's absolutely no fear.
And this will be the very, very first time
that any of these gorillas
have actually looked into a mirror
and seen a proper reflection
of themselves.
It's almost as if
they're more interested in how it feels,
rather than how it looks.
It really shows how gentle they are.
It's not like they're seeing this thing
and they want to rip it apart
and break it.
They're just exploring it
really delicately, smelling it,
touching it, looking into it.
There's no indication
that these juveniles are making
the connection between themselves
and the image in the mirror.
Even human children take a while
to recognise their own reflection.
So maybe it's just a matter of time.
Baby Mwira is intrigued.
Okay. It looks like Mwira was interested,
but Mwinga wasn't letting him play
with the new thing in the forest.
Playtime's over.
It's been fascinating,
but I suspect it would take
a lot more exposure to the mirror
before the gorillas
show signs of self-recognition.
