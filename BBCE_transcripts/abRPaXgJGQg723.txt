Title: Octopus Steals Crab from Fisherman | Super Smart Animals | BBC Earth

This is Steve...
a crab fisherman.
The basics are simple.
Put some bait in a pot...
let it sink...
sit back...
and wait for crabs to wander in.
Steve know that most crustaceans
aren't known for their IQ.
Once inside the trap,
they haven't got a clue how to get out.
The exit is obvious enough to us,
but some animals just aren't born
with much in the way of brains
But why does the seafloor here
look like a crab graveyard?
Well, there's another crab fisherman
living down here in this cave...
and it's a much more creative one
than Steve.
The animal living here
shouldn't really be a problem.
Its closest relatives are slugs,
snails and clams.
It's a giant Pacific octopus...
an animal with one huge advantage...
an enormous brain.
Taking body size into account,
only those of birds and mammals
are bigger.
Two thirds of those brain cells,
or neurons, are actually in its tentacles
and it uses them all to approach
the problem of crab poaching.
Plan A is to smother the prey.
With the metal trap in the way,
that's not too successful.
But that huge brain
helps the octopus to get creative
and to think up
a dramatically different strategy.
Once inside there's an easy meal.
But this could be its last.
Breaking in was easy...
but the octopus can do something
crabs find impossible
A sure sign that an octopus has struck,
a trail of empty shells...
and a frustrated fisherman.
What can I say?
These creative problem-solving skills
set octopus apart
from all other invertebrates.
