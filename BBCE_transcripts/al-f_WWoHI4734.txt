These calls announce the start of a raid
into land controlled by their neighbours.
As they leave their core zone,
the patrol goes silent,
occasionally stopping to listen.
Signs of the enemy are detected
and examined closely.
The chimp militia are now
at the very edge of their territory.
All need to be on maximum alert.
They must wait and listen.
An unfamiliar chimp call
raises the tension.
It's an uncertain time.
The size of the rival group
is as yet unknown.
Not far away, their neighbours
are feeding in a fig tree,
oblivious to the approaching dangers.
The patrol moves off
with a sense of purpose.
They must remain silent
until they close in on their rivals.
The attack is on!
To intimidate their opponents,
the aggressors scream
and drum on buttress roots.
Several males corner an enemy female.
It's a ferocious attack
and she's lucky to escape with her life.
Others are not so fortunate.
The battle won, a grizzly scene unfolds.
An enemy youngster
has been caught and killed.
The carcass is shared between members
of the group and eaten.
Killing a competitor makes sense
if you want to protect your food supply.
But exactly why they cannibalise
the dead chimp is not fully understood.
It may simply be a chance
for some extra protein.
