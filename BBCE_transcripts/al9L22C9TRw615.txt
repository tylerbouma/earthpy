The dart falls out,
but it's already delivered
its payload of tranquiliser.
Thankfully,
Little Pinkfoot's family is at hand.
But this could still go badly wrong.
Sylvia or her family could charge
and force the team to withdraw.
Sylvia could fall awkwardly.
Her huge bulk could restrict
her ability to breathe.
She could suffocate.
Worse still, she could fall on
Little Pinkfoot and crush her.
At first things are looking good.
But then Sylvia puts out a distress call.
Little Pinkfoot responds.
She runs back to Sylvia...
and stands right underneath
her three-tonne bulk.
For her, being right under mum
is the safest place in the world.
David and the team try to flush
Little Pinkfoot out with their vehicles...
but she just won't budge.
Eventually, David does the unthinkable.
He risks his own life
to save Little Pinkfoot's.
If Sylvia goes down now,
she could easily crush them both.
But even Little Pinkfoot weighs 100 kilos.
Moving her takes force.
The rest of the herd are wild
with distress.
They could charge at any moment.
Little Pinkfoot panics.
The team have got to get her back
to her sister's side.
Thankfully, baby elephants
instinctively follow large objects.
So, David uses his vehicle
to lead her towards her family.
Once she's safe,
the team can start their work.
The abscess is huge.
It's drained and cleaned thoroughly.
The team work as fast as they can
to reduce the stress to Sylvia
and the rest of the herd.
A vet from the Kenyan Wildlife Service
gives her a massive dose of antibiotics.
Thousands of elephants
get shot every year.
Most die slowly and painfully.
Finally, the vet gives Sylvia an antidote
to the tranquiliser to bring her round.
