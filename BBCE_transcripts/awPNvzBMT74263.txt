A touch is an invitation to get to know
each other. But is it all too good to be
true? The great silverback. He won't be so
easily impressed. Here, he's the boss. Spy
gorilla won't be welcomed
without his say so. A warning. Everyone
must stay back. Can our spy win him over too? They await the silverback's decision.
Until then, there's a line no one can
cross. His arm a barrier between them and
the newcomer. To show respect, our spy
averts his gaze .Decision made. Spy gorilla
can stay.
Everyone can relax once more. In adults,
chest-beating is a show of power. For
youngsters it's an invitation to play.
But games easily get out of hand.
Oops. His look says it all.
Best pretend it never happened.
But it's not the end for our spy. He
lives to film another day.
