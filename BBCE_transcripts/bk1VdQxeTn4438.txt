Title: Killer Whales Playing with Their Prey | Trials Of Life | BBC Earth

No other whale deliberately
beaches itself in this way,
or has perfected this method
of getting back to the sea.
As long as the sea lions
stay well up the beach,
you might think they would be safe.
But the hungry whales are very daring.
Now several of the whales
are hunting in a group.
That sea lion was keeping just ahead
of one of the whales,
but was caught by another
it probably hadn't seen.
This savage beating may be
to separate hide from flesh.
But very often the successful hunter
takes its victims straight out to sea
without even killing it.
And there it plays with its catch
as if it were exalting in triumph.
To get all the food it needs,
a killer whale must catch
at least three sea lion pups a day
and every day
throughout the breeding season
this group of skilled highly intelligent
hunters do just that.
