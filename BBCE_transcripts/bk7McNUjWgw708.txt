Title: Flying Fish Picked Off From Above And Below | The Hunt | BBC Earth

Their cover blown...
escape seems impossible.
But these particular fish
have a unique ability.
They're flying fish.
With an extra thrust from their tails,
the flying fish get airborne once more.
With a good wind, they can glide
for hundreds of metres.
But this is just what the frigatebirds
have been waiting for.
When frigates join the hunt,
the flying fish are literally caught
between the devil...
and the deep blue sea.
If the flying fish get too much lift
they become easy prey for the frigates.
If they dive to evade attack from above...
they could fall into the mouths
of the dorado.
