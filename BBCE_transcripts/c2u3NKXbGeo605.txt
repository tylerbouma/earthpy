Suddenly distant calls
unsettle the chimps.
They look to their leader, Nick,
for support.
What's happened,
the reason that they're so freaked out
is that they've heard calls
of the neighbouring community.
So, that means that their neighbours
might be actually encroaching
on their territory.
Now I think what they're gonna do
is go move in that direction
try and see off the other community...
They all go and embrace Nick.
They're frightened,
they've heard distant calls.
That's asking for reassurance.
Here he comes.
And he has got all his hair now erected,
called pilo erect.
That is just when he is showing
that he's really the boss.
This when all internal politics,
rivalries, are completely forgotten.
And it's total solidarity
amongst the community.
Once again, the rival communities calls
echoe through the forest.
If Nick is ever going to step up to
his alpha roll, he needs to do it now.
And he doesn't disappoint.
In an effort to push the rivals away,
Nick rallies the Sonsos
into a deafening chorus.
Calls everywhere, I can't distinguish
what's our chimps or neighbouring chimps.
When the chimps are psyched like this,
they move through vegetation so quickly.
Then as suddenly as it started it's over.
The rival community has backed off.
The Sonso chimps will hold on to
their dwindling territory for another day.
