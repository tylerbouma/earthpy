be taken away with strings on them
on the riverbank shantytowns have built

this is one of those frontier towns
that's just all about logging so its
sprung up after the big fires that hit
Cali Montana in 1997 and really
completely destroyed this area which

move in and more easily pick their way
through what was left of the forest take

alright yeah what is the home village
but the lobby sorry - yeah no oh did I
get it further than he got it yeah even
if he's being reluctant with the phrase
she says I did a good
