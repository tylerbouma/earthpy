Title: Dolphins Fishing on Land | BBC Earth

it's high tide and huge shoals of mullet
are feeding in the shallows
traveling at speeds of up to 30 km/h
they drive the mullet onto the beach
tracked the fish have nowhere to turn
flattening out their bodies like
surfboards they skim in just inches of
water
the surf mums are the only dolphins in
the world that hide a plane and Beach

it looks fun but this is a high-risk
game
they could easily strand but with a few
effortless wriggles they're back in the
water
what's so fascinating is that it's only
the moms and their daughters who surf
like this
