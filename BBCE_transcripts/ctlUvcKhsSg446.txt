as the planets urban landscapes grow by
the day it's most important wild spaces
a shrinking
in South America trees are cleared for
farming
in the Amazon small patches of green
protected by local tribes are all that
remain of a once great forest
and on the island of Madagascar
images taken over 30 years so it has
lost almost 80% of its original forest
with so few trees left to hold the soil
in place the red earth now runs into the
rivers and out into the ocean
it looks like Madagascar is bleeding
