exactly 50 years after Crick and Watson
had worked out the structure of DNA the
human genome was cracked and this is it
in these volumes is all the information
needed to define the genetic structure
of the human species each number refers
to one of our 23 chromosomes
if I open it up you can see that the
text consists of just one very very very
long list of just four letters ACTG
each combination represents instructions
for one element in the human design this
is a secret language of DNA this is the
book of life
