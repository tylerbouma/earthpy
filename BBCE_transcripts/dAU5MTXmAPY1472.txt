the arms race is very much alive at this
stage the Warblers can fight back and
their defenses can work for the Cuckoo's
trickery to be successful there is a lot
she has to do
she must first remove one or more war
blegh to make room for her egg
she has to lay a similar-looking egg so
it's not recognized and thrown out and
she has to do this quickly so she
doesn't alert the Warblers
if the cuckoo gets all this right the
trap is set
you
warblers who have been tricked can have
no idea of what is to come
