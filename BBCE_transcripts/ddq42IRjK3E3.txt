[Music]
[Music]
meadows that only a few weeks ago
were buried beneath the snow are now
full
of life
but in these mountains the good times
will not last
long so the bears must feed as fast as
they can
during the summer months an adult can
put on 180 kilos
gorging on plants and if they can catch
them
[Music]
a mormont or two
but just now the bears have something
else
on their minds
it's becoming warmer and the bears are
keen to shed their thick winter coats
mothers show the cubs what to do about
this
they'll soon catch on
some trees it seems are particularly
suitable for rubbing
bears have their favorites and will
travel long distances to visit them
some itches just have to be scratched
[Music]
there are now around 30 bears in this
one valley
[Music]
as they rub each leaves an individual
and recognizable scent
[Applause]
so the tree soon carries a list of who's
around
which might help individuals to avoid a
fight
to best spread their scent they really
have to put their back into it
[Music]
[Music]
but summer is short itches
satisfactorily scratched it's time
to eat
in a couple of months they will have to
return to their dens to hibernate
so now they must put on as much weight
as they can
[Music]
