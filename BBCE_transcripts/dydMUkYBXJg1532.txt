I really wasn't happy seeing Eric like
this I know it's all for him and at the
end of the day he goes home but still it
was really horrible to see him get so
stressed and so upset I felt useless
the full bag of me
actually it's really freaked me out that
actually especially the bit under Andy
you know hums the shade where we have to
getting down and give him an injection I
know it is the best thing but now it's
not even moving this doesn't see
