[Music]
[Music]
as they mature
young males begin to explore the
boundaries of the pride's territory
red has ventured out alone
[Music]
and london straight into the middle of
the hyena clan
okay
he's trapped by over 20 of them
the pack tries to wear him down
this number of hyenas could kill him
[Music]
it's impossible to fight them all at
[Music]
once
[Music]
he can't keep them at bay for much
longer
he's towering fast
this ally tattoo has heard the commotion
[Music]
[Music]
now the odds have changed
even for 20 hyenas a pair of male lions
is too much to take on
[Music]
red is lucky
mantids will eat anything that moves
including other mantids
time to leave
this tiny insect is now open to attack
from predators lurking in the
undergrowth
[Music]
whether an individual mantis survives or
not
is partly a matter of chance
whether it's spotted by a predator
whether it turns right or left
so far its luck has held
but this hungry jumping spider is still
in pursuit
a mantis is born with exceptional
eyesight
but the spiders is even better
[Music]
although this young mantis can't yet fly
its long four legs evolve to catch
prey give it reach
[Music]
so
there seems to be no escape
but this mantis has a surprising line in
self-defense
kung fu praying mantis style
[Music]
of course it's all bluff trying to look
bigger and confuse
[Music]
away with it just
staying alive for its first few hours
is a significant accomplishment for a
new enhanced insect
but there's still a long way to go with
a bit of luck
in two months time it will be as big and
beautiful
as this orchid man did
or maybe not
after all mantids are cannibals
hermit crabs use abandoned seashells as
mobile homes
[Music]
as a crab grows its shell becomes an
ever tighter fit
so eventually a crab needs to move in to
a bigger one
[Music]
suitable empty shelves are few and far
between
and this one is far too spacious for
this crab
but instead of continuing its search
this small crab settles down to weight
[Music]
other crabs also looking to upgrade to a
bigger home
soon gather whenever a shell washes
ashore
[Music]
unfortunately the new shell is too big
for them
too
[Music]
despite that the gathering crabs begin
to measure
each other up and then they do something
really rather extraordinary
they arrange themselves into an orderly
queue
the biggest at the front smallest at the
back
they're lining up with one aim to
exchange
properties
but none of the crabs can make a move
because the chain
is not yet complete
they're all waiting for the right-sized
crab to come along
and this is it
[Music]
the latest arrival pushes to the head of
the queue
[Music]
at first the chain falls apart
[Music]
as it reforms the small crab finally
makes its move
and takes its place at the end of the
[Music]
line
[Music]
after a close inspection the big crab
moves in
[Music]
this triggers a chain reaction
each crab hurriedly moves into the shell
vacated by the crab ahead of it in the
line
just as the small crab attempts to move
into its new home
a fresh arrival muscles in
[Music]
to be left without a shell is a death
sentence
a naked crab will quickly cook under the
intense tropical sun
[Music]
but after all the swapping there is
still
one shell left
sadly it's no bigger than this small
crabs original shell
[Music]
and worse it's got a hole in it
[Music]
but even a bad shell is better than
being homeless
at this time of year polar bears on
average
succeed only once in 20 hunts
if the hunter is skinny like this one
that
may not be often enough
all she can do is keep trying
[Music]
[Music]
to prevent her scent betraying her she
makes a wide sweep
to get downwind of the seal
getting close
she's now right behind the seal
[Applause]
[Applause]
incredibly she caught the seal
underwater
[Applause]
it's only small but even so its blubber
alone
will contain a hundred thousand calories
enough to sustain this bear for a week
[Music]
and in that time she might even catch
another
[Music]
but this can't go on forever as summer
continues
temperatures are rising each hunt
requires more energy draining the bears
of their reserves
[Music]
for kangaroos the greatest challenges
come from within their own society
[Music]
for a male there's only really one key
lesson to learn
in his life
to get to the top he must become
a fighter
[Music]
the battles are so brutal that males
need years of training
to prepare
the effort is worth it because a
champion fighter
wins privileged access to the females
this meadow is a boot camp for aspiring
boxers
training starts as soon as a youngster
is out of the pouch
its mother is a handy opponent for a
young joey
learning the basics
but he's soon off in search of more
sparring partners
the other grown-ups are not so tolerant
of this lightweight
[Music]
[Music]
this male alone rules the meadow
[Music]
he stands eight feet tall his muscles
hardened by years
of sparring
today a challenger for his title has
come forward
full-blown fights are so dangerous
they're not entered into
lightly
but when two males square up it's time
to clear the arena
anything goes in these power struggles
eye gouging is entirely within the rules
so is kicking below the belt
the dominant male skill is already
[Music]
telling
[Music]
the stakes are high they risk
broken bones and internal injuries
suddenly it's all over
the champion has beaten off the
challenger at least for now
[Music]
the drunko is the kalahari's greatest
trickster
and these are his victims
a family of meerkats desert specialists
after warming up in the morning sun the
meerkats begin their search for
breakfast
the drongo can now begin his tricks
but he must first win the confidence of
his victims
[Music]
he spots an eagle on the hunt and sounds
a warning
one that sends the meerkats gratefully
scurrying to safety
danger over
and now he has their trust
he sounds another warning
but this time it's a false alarm
thank you very much
the meerkats fell for it
[Music]
this all seems too easy he tries the
same trick again
[Applause]
but the mishaps aren't stupid they'll
only fall for it once
the juicy scorpion won't be for him
then suddenly the sound of a sentence
warning
no meerkat can ignore that sensors never
lie
but the center sees no danger
[Music]
guess who
[Music]
of course it's the dronco he's learned
to mimic the meerkat's
own warning call
and now he can enjoy his prize
[Music]
a gang of meerkats outsmarted
by a bird
eyes and ears that were closed for the
first two weeks of her life
are now opening
and with this comes a whole new world of
sensory stimulation
[Music]
she uses her vision to move around but
does she see the world the same way we
do
well dogs are colorblind
but that doesn't mean that everything is
black and white
she does see color but mostly just blues
and yellows
it's because she only has two types of
color receptors
compared to humans who have three
and it's also why your dog will often
ignore an orange toy in the green grass
as those colors look the same to them
better to give them something blue
but it's when things are moving that her
vision comes into its own
dog's eyes process what they see more
quickly than we do
it's almost like they see in slow motion
that's why they're always in the right
place to catch the frisbee
a dog's hearing is also super human
they can hear things four times further
away and twice as high pitched as we can
it's why we can't hear dog whistles
but it also means they can hear the hum
of lights
and even the pulsing sound of a quartz
crystal in a digital clock
but there's one sense she'll use more
than any other
her sense of smell
a dog's brain is one tenth the size of
ours
but the part that controls smell is 40
times larger
even the river normally a lifeline for
the animals
has almost disappeared
yet the mud soup that remains could be
concealing
a free lunch
if only the leopards can figure out what
it is
and how to get it
[Music]
are these weird apparitions something to
fear
or a harmless and much needed source of
[Music]
food
the mother has probably never seen a
live catfish before
[Music]
eventually she'd lose his courage
perhaps a son will be bolder
he has spotted some fish of his own
when they stop moving though he seems
not to know where they've gone
it's the elephant that finally reveals
them
you could almost see like a light bulb
going on
and literally right after the elephant
pulled out he went straight in
so
it was like playing with soap in the
shower he just sort of fumbled around
didn't know what to do there's mud being
splattered on his body and on his face
finally he actually bit it which gave
him a grip on it
i just remember that expression when he
stood up
he was so proud of his achievement
he was quite stoked
[Music]
[Music]
you can see how the younger wolves are
excited by the arrival of their father
storm
these younger wolves are his pups from
previous years
in fact they still lick at his mouth to
be fed like they did when they were
small
[Music]
it's so rare to see this i feel very
lucky
[Music]
uh
but then my eye in the sky spots a black
bear
approaching the den
i see it before the wolves do they don't
realize the approaching threat
while the black bear would be
hard-pressed to take on an adult
it could be after the pups
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
every time the bear tries to go into the
trees where the pups are
storm bites him in the rear forcing the
bear to turn back
to face
[Music]
by working together a combination of
pushing from behind
and leading him on storm in his
offspring
get the bear away from the den
i think that bear is just as happy as
the wolves to be out of there
the character of the forest changes as
you descend
becoming ever darker and damper favoring
different kinds of animals and plants
[Music]
less than two percent of the sunlight
reaches the floor
but even here there is extraordinary
variety
in the great island of new guinea there
are 42 different species of birds of
paradise
each more bizarre than the last
this forest is so rich that nourishing
food can be gathered very quickly
that leaves the male six plumed bird of
paradise with time to concentrate on
other matters
like tidying up his display area
everything must be and spam
all is ready
[Music]
very impressive but no one is watching
the superb bird of paradise calls to
attract a female
and he has more luck
but what does he have to do to really
impress her
[Music]
she retires to consider her verdict
[Music]
it's hard not to feel deflated when even
your
best isn't good enough
escape seems impossible
but these particular fish have a unique
[Music]
ability
[Music]
they are flying fish
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
with an extra thrust from their tails
the flying fish get airborne once more
with a good wind they can glide for
hundreds of meters
but this is just what the frigate birds
have been waiting for
[Music]
when frigates join the hunt the flying
fish are
literally caught between the devil
and the deep blue sea
[Music]
if the flying fish get too much lift
they become easy prey for the frigates
[Music]
if they dive to evade attacks from above
[Music]
they could fall into the mouths of the
dorado
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
spinosaurus is also forced into direct
competition with any large predators
living in the same environment
and here that can only mean one animal
[Music]
carcaradontosaurus
[Music]
contests over carcasses are common
but outcomes of such fights are far from
guaranteed
risk of injury for big animals is acute
modern komodo dragons are often killed
in fights over carcasses
more than three meters longer
spinosaurus has size and power on its
side
[Music]
but carcaradontosaurus has the more
lethal bite
this time the spinosaurus triumphed
[Music]
but the balance of power between these
two deadly killers is a precarious one
[Music]
in 2008 a spinosaurus vertebrae was
recovered
of the tall neural spine of the bone was
broken off
it appeared to have been bitten in half
it's been suggested that the bite was
inflicted by carcaladontosaurus
spinosaurus was the last and the largest
of the fish-eating dinosaurs
but ultimately these specialists were
doomed
something way beyond their control
caused their downfall
94 million years ago the climate changed
global sea levels began to rise the
swamps and rivers that spinosaurus
thrived in
gradually were lost
[Music]
with their loss spinosaurus's specialism
became a vulnerability
[Music]
and the biggest predator ever known to
have walked the earth
[Music]
disappeared
[Applause]
the perfect launch
and a controlled drop this is as good a
descent
as it's possible to make
[Music]
its parents are there to meet it
[Music]
a little dazed perhaps but all in one
piece
one gosling at least hasn't made it
and this chick appears to be in a bad
[Music]
way
[Music]
at last it responds to its mother's
[Music]
calls
the resilience of a barnacle goose chick
is extraordinary
but there are still chicks unaccounted
for somewhere
amongst the rubble
[Music]
the parents can't risk searching because
they need to lead their two survivors
away quickly
before predators arrive
a third one has made it
but it needs to catch up
reunited
[Music]
three out of five chicks have made it
without such a dramatic start in life
it's unlikely any of them would have
even got this far
[Music]
northern australia has the highest tides
in the tropics
which expose vast areas of shoreline
and here lives a truly extraordinary
species
of octopus
[Music]
octopuses are marine animals they live
and breathe underwater
at low tide most octopuses will be
imprisoned
in their rocky pools
but this is no ordinary octopus
[Music]
[Music]
it's the only one specially adapted to
walk
on land
[Music]
it pulls itself along using the hundreds
of tiny suckers
that line its arms hunting for crabs
it walks from pool to pool
apart from a rather startled fish
this one is empty
so the octopus moves on
[Music]
a rock pool may seem like a safe refuge
but the octopuses suckers enable it to
move
just as stealthily in water as out of it
[Music]
nowhere is safe when this octopus
is around
[Music]
the gun is ready to meet again
she spent all morning calling for a job
[Music]
but so far there's no reply
[Music]
when he doesn't appear for three days we
all join
the search
picking up his trail
following his footprints
we're all worried
and then we find him
dead
[Music]
not killed by poachers
but poisoned by a villager protecting
his cattle
[Music]
but vagani doesn't know her mate is dead
she's still searching for him
[Music]
she can smell him but he's gone
[Music]
she cries for three days after his death
[Music]
we are both heartbroken the father leads
one
team the mother intercepts a panicking
elk
[Music]
they all share the spoils
but all is not quite as collaborative as
it seems
this pack strategy works well for the
alpha couple
but not quite so well for last year's
offspring
the youngsters could have their own pups
but for the alpha couple
that would mean more mouths to feed and
less for their litter
so the alpha couple will actively
discourage last year's offspring from
mating
but one of their daughters has other
ideas
skulking behind the pack is a lone male
wolf he has no territory of his own
but follows the family scavenging
leftovers
and looking for opportunities he spotted
one
the young daughter
the intruder could be in with a chance
as long as he's not caught
the pack leader could kill him
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
while the pack is distracted by a bison
the temptation for the young female is
too great
and she sneaks away to join the
mysterious stranger
it's risky but it could be her only
chance to get close
to a potential mate
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
when mating wolves lock together
unable to separate for half an hour to
ensure fertilization
[Music]
not so good if you're about to be caught
by your dad
the affair was always destined to be a
short one
[Music]
uh
[Music]
after a painful separation her new mate
is chased away
with his tail between his legs
a mud skipper a fish that spends most of
its life
out of the sea
it can walk on land and breathe air
its life is very different from that of
most fish
a fish out of water maybe
but they thrive here in japan
so what's made this upheaval worthwhile
the answer
lies in the mud
as the tide retreats it exposes mud
flats
sunlight hits the rich silt and tiny
plants and animals flourish there
all food for a mudskipper
but life on land is not without problems
it's hard work to find a mate
[Music]
jumping high above the mud will get you
noticed
[Music]
with eyes perched on the top of their
heads the mudskippers keep a lookout for
both friend
and foe
and males fight those who intrude on
their territory
[Applause]
they must also take care not to dry out
in the sun
rolling in the ooze keeps the skin cool
and
moist
for this smaller species a better option
is to retreat underground
so he digs himself a tunnel down into
the mud
[Music]
his heap of spoil is an indication of
the extent of his excavations
with the tide flooding the tunnel twice
a day
maintenance is a real burden
there will be no easy meals on this
island
walruses are the largest seals in the
world they weigh over a ton
and are armed with tusks a meter long
[Music]
exhausted from his swim the bear must
regain his strength
the next day a sea fog shrouds the
island
the wallaces sense that they're in
danger
using the fog as cover the bear
approaches the herd
the adults close ranks around their
young presenting a wall of blubber and
hide
he tests the banner but it stands firm
it appears that the world's largest land
carnivore
has met his match
there must be a in the armor
somewhere
[Music]
not here
[Music]
this female walrus is shielding her pup
if he can just prise her off
the bear's claws and teeth can't
penetrate her thick hide
[Music]
with the herd retreating to water the
bear must move quickly
having failed with one he heads straight
for another
[Music]
the chance of his first meal in months
is slipping away
he seems increasingly desperate
it's now or never
he must avoid the stabbing tusks if he's
the wind
[Music]
the flailing walrus is immensely
powerful
and drags the bear away from the
shallows towards the safety of the herd
[Music]
it slips from his grasp
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
you
