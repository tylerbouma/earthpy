Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIt0ub7PhWY


Minako a relative of the camel two
metres tall and over three times the
weight of a puma
the mother's only hope is to go for the
throat and try to suffocate her prey
[Laughter]
[Music]
her Cubs try to help
[Music]
but they themselves don't yet have the
skills or the weight to bring down such
large prey
and the mother is now badly injured
her wounds are severe and will take
weeks to heal properly
[Music]
but without food her cubs won't survive
for long
[Music]
