Title: Extraordinary Octopus Takes To Land | The Hunt | BBC Earth

Northern Australia
has the highest tides in the tropics,
which expose vast areas of shoreline.
And here lives
a truly extraordinary species of octopus.
Octopuses are marine animals.
They live and breathe underwater.
At low tide, most octopuses
would be imprisoned in their rocky pools.
But this is no ordinary octopus.
It's the only one
specially adapted to walk on land.
It pulls itself along, using the hundreds
of tiny suckers that line its arms.
Hunting for crabs,
it walks from pool to pool.
Apart from a rather startled fish...
this one is empty.
So, the octopus moves on.
A rock pool may seem like a safe refuge.
But the octopus's suckers
enable it to move
just as stealthily in water as out of it.
Nowhere is safe
when this octopus is around.
