Title: Crabs Trade Shells in the Strangest Way | BBC Earth

Hermit crabs use abandoned seashells
as mobile homes.
As a crab grows, its shell
becomes an ever tighter fit.
So, eventually,
a crab needs to move in to a bigger one.
Suitable empty shells
are few and far between...
And this one is far too spacious
for this crab.
But instead of continuing its search,
this small crab settles down to wait.
Other crabs,
also looking to upgrade to a bigger home,
soon gather
whenever a shell washes ashore.
Unfortunately, the new shell
is too big for them, too.
Despite that, the gathering crabs
begin to measure each other up,
and then they do something
really rather extraordinary.
They arrange themselves
into an orderly queue.
The biggest at the front,
smallest at the back.
They're lining up with one aim,
to exchange properties.
But none of the crabs can make a move,
because the chain is not yet complete.
They're all waiting
for the right sized crab to come along.
And this is it.
The latest arrival
pushes to the head of the queue.
At first, the chain falls apart.
As it reforms,
the small crab finally makes its move...
and takes its place
at the end of the line.
After a close inspection,
the big crab moves in.
This triggers a chain-reaction.
Each crab hurriedly moves into the shell
vacated by the crab ahead of it
in the line.
Just as the small crab attempts
to move into its new home...
a fresh arrival muscles in.
To be left without a shell
is a death sentence.
A naked crab will quickly cook
under the intense tropical sun.
But, after all the swapping,
there is still one shell left.
Sadly, it's no bigger
than this small crab's original shell.
And worse, it's got a hole in it.
But even a bad shell
is better than being homeless.
