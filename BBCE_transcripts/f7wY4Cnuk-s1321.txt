this unusual duck pond provides an
overnight sanctuary and when day breaks
a rare chance to feed
just ten meters beneath the ice the sea
floor is carpeted with dense mussel beds
these can only be reached during a brief
lull in the currents the ducts must
quickly prise the mussels free before
the tide starts to turn
you
the window of opportunity is short as
the current begins to build its up up
and away
these permanent holes in the ice
provides seafood throughout winter the
diners attract others in the Arctic any
breach in the icy barrier can be a
lifeline
