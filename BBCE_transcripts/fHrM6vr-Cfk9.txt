time for the ultimate killer's test
how would the piranha react to my duck
so
we have our oven ready here
just give it a devil
and give some meditation as if the
animal was in distress
yep and then make some movements and to
release some blood from it
right okay sir you've got to make it
look as if this animal's uh
struggling to break free of the surface
and maybe it's had a broken wing it's
bleeding
we knew they were there but they're very
wary
first a small scout darts in to take a
bite and checks how the prey reacts
if it gets a violent reaction they all
back off but if not
then the whole pack just piles in
[Applause]
[Music]
just a few minutes later
okay time for me to get to grips with
one
carefully slightly and get the other
hand behind the gills picking up
piranhas is like handling a cocked and
loaded gun
with a hair trigger let's have a look at
the teeth we can
see just how powerful those jaws are
they are incredible aren't they
cut straight through flesh
let's uh get some idea of how much it
bites if i put the blade its mouth
oh my god
you're good that's incredible that's
that sound is just
oh my god bang bang they will actually
cut through metal
god he doesn't give up does he no he
doesn't his eyes will be watching all
the time they're very very alert
yeah right well i think he's getting a
bit frustrated so i'll
put him back in the water with his
thousands of friends and hope his
memory's not so good
ripening fig trees overhanging the
water's edge
provide welcome food for shoals of
hungry fish
the commotion attracts dorado known
locally
as the river tiger
[Music]
they patrol the feeding shuttles looking
for a chance
to strike
[Music]
and waiting in the wings ready to pick
off any injured fish
are the piranhas
[Music]
a feeding frenzy quickly develops
piranha can strip a fish to the bone in
minutes
oh no
oh i had something big there and it's
got a way
ah i'm almost certain that was a black
piranha
yeah close but not close enough
but having everyone fishing has paid off
the guy in the next boat has just caught
something and passed me his line
okay it's a black piranha
it's not one of the real monsters in
fact
it's quite average size although you can
see it still has
quite a snap on it and a superlative
set of gnashers ah
really mistimed that quite badly
oh ow
well it was about time that happened
i've been catching piranhas for a long
long time and i've not been bitten yet
but that's my first piranha battle scar
the black piranha is really very
distinctive
very dark in color but it has these
incredible
red eyes it has a very very stocky
body look at it in cross section if you
look at it end on
you can see it's almost bulldog-like in
appearance
but because it's not very long it's very
maneuverable it can move
incredibly quickly moving in towards
food
taking a bite and then instantly
swimming away at great pace
they don't actually hunt in packs as is
traditionally believed or in shoals
actually they tend to hunt on their own
now looking at this one here you can see
it's a little bit tatty around the tail
and around these fins here and the
reason for that is that other piranhas
will actually come
in and take big chunks out of the fins
they are cannibalistic they will eat
their own kind and they'll certainly
waste no opportunity to munch down big
chunks of these fins but
leaving the fish alive and let me just
see if i can show you
these teeth look at those
absolutely fearsome
the black piranha with its burning red
eyes
and some of the sharpest teeth on earth
it truly is one of the most fearsome
hunters of the flooded forest
and gotta go on the deadly 60.
when it comes to hunting there aren't
many fishermen who can catch fish as
impressively as a giant otter
and with so many mouths to feed the
family take every available opportunity
to go fishing
that's just as well as a fully grown
giant otter
needs around four kilos of fish a day
and on this body of water that means the
most infamous
fish of them all is at the top of the
menu
the piranha
piranhas are really common on the lake
and diablo and the others seem to love
them
it begs the question though how can he
teach his cubs to take them on without
getting bitten by those razor-sharp
teeth
charlie decides to try and see just how
aggressive the piranhas are
by attaching a chunk of meat to an
underwater camera
[Music]
with the underwater camera wired to a
monitor on the boat
charlie can get an otter's eye view of
the murky world beneath him
[Music]
the piranha's acute sense of smell helps
them detect the meat almost immediately
what fascinates charlie though is how
frenzied they are at devouring it
in less than 30 seconds the meat is gone
the otter cubs will have to move at
lightning speed to catch their dinner
without being bitten
it's a skill they have to learn
[Music]
[Applause]
