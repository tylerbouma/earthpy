ripening fig trees overhanging the
water's edge provide welcome food for
shoals of hungry fish
the commotion attracts Dorado known
locally as the river tiger

they patrol the feeding Charles looking
for a chance to strike
[Music]
and waiting in the wings ready to pick
off any injured fish are the piranhas
[Music]
a feeding frenzy quickly develops
piranhas can strip a fish to the bone in
minutes
[Music]
