This is the home of one forest creature
that has lived here in the Congo
for 44 million years.
Picathartes.
These birds mate for life
and the male reaffirms the bond
by displaying to the female.
They're building a mud nest on
the underside of the boulder's overhang,
where it'll be protected from the rain.
The female takes the lead.
The male doesn't seem quite so skilful.
Oh, dear.
Luckily, she can put things right.
Now she's collecting the soft furnishings.
He's brought some, too,
but he still can't get it right.
In the end, the female seems satisfied
with the finish and just in time.
It might look
as if he has been banished into the rain,
but in fact, they're a great team.
They share the incubation,
12 hours on, 12 hours off,
for the next three weeks.
In due course, there are mouths to feed
and now the male must prove his worth.
Worms are a good start
and he's doing well.
But the chicks are insatiable.
Fortunately, other things are on the menu.
He might be a poor nest-builder...
but he is redeeming himself now.
