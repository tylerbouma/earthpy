The next morning
and the cubs are doing well.
There we go.
Two little boys!
They're a healthy 1.2 kilograms each.
And as the days roll by,
the cubs continue to thrive
under Giles's watchful eye.
So, we try and spend a little bit
of time with them every day.
It's really important,
because, ultimately, from day one,
we've been building a bond with them.
And the fact that
they just get used to hearing my voice
and the sensation of being touched
and picked up and stuff is really good.
His eyes are still completely closed.
This is day eight...
-Yeah, it's usually between six and 12.
-Yeah.
Are you going to stay still
for just a second?
-Wow!
-See? They're growing.
They're growing... That's 200 grams again
in a day. That's fantastic.
So, they're only 12 days old and they're
already double their birth weight.
The stronger and bigger you get,
the quicker you get
and the better your chance
of survival in the wild.
I just noticed
that one little eye was open.
Which is awesome.
You can see me now sort of.
Well, you can see a shadow anyway.
For the first couple of weeks, they're not
going to be able to focus properly.
Like a human baby, like, it takes
a few weeks for the eyes to adjust.
Two weeks later,
the cubs are growing stronger
and it's time for Giles
to give them names.
So, if you look at
the two of them together,
this little chap has more of
a continuous stripe going along this way,
whereas this one's a bit more broken.
It looks like a spot.
So, we're calling this one Spot
for the time being and this one Stripe.
And he tends to have a little bit more
of a feisty character than his brother.
He is going to be a challenge,
I can see it already.
See what I mean about being stroppy?
Aren't you? Yeah.
That's good, you've got spirit.
So, this one we're calling Spot.
This little chap was the first one born.
He was the one that, for the first couple
of hours, we were a little worried about.
He had a bit of a tougher time.
Didn't you?
You're doing well. He's nearly
the same weight as his brother now.
Despite their good health,
life for young tigers is precarious.
Globally, over a third of captive-born
Sumatran cubs won't make it to adulthood.
So, you need to relax, like your brother.
Relax, eh?
So, Giles has made a difficult decision
to safeguard the cubs' future.
Oh! You're going to pass
with flying colours, buddy.
He's going to hand-raise them himself at
home, so he can give them 24-hour care.
And Mel the vet has come to check
if they're healthy enough to leave.
Well, the heart sounds really good.
Steady beat, no murmurs.
-So relaxed he is!
-He's strong. He's so relaxed.
We're starting off
with such robust, healthy little cubs.
They're not too young. So, they've already
got so much strength in them.
Yeah.
The cubs will be vulnerable to illness
until they're around six weeks old.
So, Giles has got to keep a close eye
on them round the clock.
There is an awful lot of pressure,
you know.
First and foremost,
you know, there's pressure
because these guys are so important
to not only us here at the zoo,
but also to the breeding programme.
Potentially, a lot of eyes around
the world that are watching
what we're doing
and making sure we do a good job.
We'll give it a good go, eh?
We'll give it a good go. You're so fluffy!
Hand-raising the cubs
will also help prepare them
for their future lives at the zoo.
