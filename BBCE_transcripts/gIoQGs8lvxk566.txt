Title: Otter Family Defeats Caiman in an Incredible Fight | BBC Earth

Just as they've done before,
Diablo and the family
have to deal with this threat.
All the adults start to harass the caiman.
As the cubs keep their distance,
Sophia takes her position at the front,
sizing up the caiman.
Others move in to try to distract it.
Diablo once again moves in from behind
and goes for the tail.
But the Cayman refuses to back down.
And then begins to fight back.
The cubs panic and follow the adults
right into the middle of the fight.
They're in extreme danger now,
so, the adult authors step up the assault.
The caiman tries to head
for the safety of the bushes,
but it's too late. He's outnumbered.
The otters seize the moment.
Incredibly, they overpower the caiman,
some holding it down,
others biting it in the head.
After nearly an hour of brutal fighting...
it's all over.
The caiman may be dead, but Charlie needs
to know if all the otters are okay.
It doesn't take long to realize two
of the cubs haven't survived the fight.
Stuck in the middle of the action
like this, the young, inexperienced cubs
were no match for
such a powerful and aggressive predator.
The truce between otters and caiman
has, for a brief moment, been broken.
What impresses Charlie the most, though,
is the incredible show of family bonds
and physical strength
the Otters brought together
to kill the caiman
and eliminate the threat of it
from their lake.
