Title: Genius Meerkats Solve Puzzles | BBC Earth

Over the last ten years,
Dr Alex Thornton has designed
a series of tests to try to find out
how information spreads through
meerkat societies and how they innovate.
I designed a series of innovation tasks
to look at which individuals in groups
would be likely to innovate solutions
to new problems.
In this experiment, a scorpion is served
to a meerkat in a modified lunch box.
To get to the snack, its instinct
is to try and take route one
through the clear plastic walls.
But some meerkats can learn
to put aside that instinct
and take a different approach.
There's another way in.
Turn the lid.
In fact, the individuals
that were likely to solve them
were low-ranking subordinate individuals
and particularly males.
Dominant individuals were
able to get food by stealing,
so they don't need to innovate.
It's the low-ranking individuals
that need to innovate
because, essentially,
necessity is the mother of invention.
And especially the males,
because it's the males
who will leave their natal group,
to go and look for
breeding opportunities elsewhere,
so they're really going
to face hardship when they leave.
And it pays for them to try and figure out
new ways of getting food.
