It's now midsummer
and the sun is shining at full strength.
The increasing warmth
is the cue for an Atlantic lobster
to start on a long journey.
She's spent the winter 250 metres down,
far beyond the reach of the storms.
But it was cold down there
and now she needs to find warmer water,
so she's marching towards the shallows.
They, however, are 150 kilometres away.
After a month of walking,
she finally arrives
at her favourite sand bank.
But she's not the first here.
Dozens of lobsters have already
dug themselves homes in the sand
and they don't intend to surrender them
to newcomers.
Size counts for everything
in these battles.
The new arrival is in urgent need of a pit
and since she weighs a hefty seven kilos,
she stands a good chance of getting one.
She's won.
These battles continue for
the next two months and they're crucial
for the females must have both shelter
and warm water,
if they're to raise their young.
For the last seven months,
each of these females has been carrying
around about 20,000 fertilised eggs,
but their task is approaching its end.
The warmth of the shallows
is speeding the eggs' development.
Two more months
and the eggs are ready to hatch.
At first,
they're not very good at swimming.
But within a few minutes, the babies
are able to set off in a purposeful way.
