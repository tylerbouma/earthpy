Time for the ultimate killers test.
How would the piranha react to my duck?
So, we have our oven ready here.
Just give it a dabble.
Give some agitation
as if the animal is in distress.
Yep and then make some movements,
to release some blood from it.
Alright. Okay.
We've got to make it look
as if this animal
is struggling to break free
of the surface.
Maybe it's had a broken wing,
it's bleeding.
We knew that were there
but they're very wary.
First, a small scout
darts in to take a bite
and checks how the prey reacts.
If it gets a violent reaction
they all back off.
But if not then the whole pack piles in.
Just a few minutes later...
Time for me to get to grips with one.
Carefully.
Picking up piranhas is like handling
a cocked and loaded gun,
with a hair-trigger.
Let's have a look at the teeth.
We can see just how powerful
those jaws are.
They are incredible aren't they?
They cut straight through flesh.
Let's get some idea of how much
it bites if I put the blade in its mouth.
Oh my God.
That's incredible.
That's that sound is just--
There you go, you see, bang, bang.
They will actually cut through metal.
-He doesn't give up, does he?
-No, he doesn't.
His eyes will be watching all the time.
They're very very alert fish.
I think he's getting a bit frustrated
so I'll put him back in the water,
with this thousands of friends
and hope his memory is not so good.
