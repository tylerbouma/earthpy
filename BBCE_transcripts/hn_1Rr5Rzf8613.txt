If they become separated,
they could easily drown.
Oh, my God! One is gone!
The mothers try in vain,
but they can't contain all three.
As they save one, another washes away.
Oh, God! They're still going
and the baby's gone.
Soon, all three
are being swept downstream fast,
through the crocodile-infested waters.
The current's even too much
for the mothers.
They have to let their babies go.
David can't see
how they can possibly survive.
Oh, man, this is no good.
-Let's go. Let's go.
-Let's go.
You can hear the poor females.
Okay, Apo. No, no, no. Right, right.
All the big females are running.
Oh, God.
Okay, one baby's out.
Man, the other one is here.
The other one is here.
Wow!
There are two babies actually here.
Wow, they're really tough.
Come on, big females, come in!
Oh, please don't move.
Oh, they're coming down.
The females are coming down.
I hope they will save them
because they will get tired
and if a croc grabs them, that's it.
The poor mothers
just don't know what to do.
They have no way of lifting them out.
And David can't even help.
Oh, come on, females,
get in and save the babies!
The riverbank is sheer
and the babies are weak and terrified.
Oh, man! That is so relieving.
It's so joyful to see all of them again,
coming back together.
