The differences are only in the animals
themselves,
their strategies, and their settings.
In the sky, there's no place
for a stalking predator to hide.
So for the element of surprise,
the peregrine falcon
has to resort to sheer speed.
In a dive, it's the fastest bird
in the world.
So fast, it's breathtaking.
It stalks by flying high
and relying on eyes
that are as good as telescopes.
The fat, slow-looking pigeon
might seem to be doomed,
but it evolved as peregrines evolved,
and is equipped to watch for them.
Eyes on the side of its head
enable the pigeon
to forage for seed and scan the sky
the same time.
It spies the peregrine.
And once it's in the air,
it becomes a racer.
The peregrine.
Lightness, streamlining, speed.
The pigeon.
Strength, endurance, enough speed,
and a head start.
The peregrine is more manoeuvrable.
The pigeon has a wider field of vision,
though,
and plenty of manoeuvers of its own.
It's also flying for its life.
This time, the pigeon outflies
its pursuer.
This peregrine is still young
and just learning
that speed by itself isn't always enough.
It must raise its game.
