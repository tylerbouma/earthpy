In the tropical forest through New Guinea,
one male is dedicated to making
an unforgettable first impression.
The six-plumed bird of paradise
is cleaning his display ground.
He obsessively tidies every fallen leaf.
His stage must be meticulously tidy for
what will be an incredible performance.
A few attractive berries to help decorate
the floor.
This final touch is hardly ever seen.
Might he think he's found
a bit of old snakeskin?
Some scientists believe he's trying to add
the scent of a snake
to ward off predators.
For others, it's a cleaning cloth
and he's polishing a perch for a female.
Later he uses a bigger bit of rag and does
the same.
Only strong healthy and well-fed males
can afford the time and effort
for the most meticulous preparation,
and in theory, they're the ones
with better genes to pass on.
He'll have a highly critical audience,
so it's time to rehearse the main act.
His dance steps perfected, he's ready
to start the show for real.
He spots a female nearby,
so quickly goes to get
more berries to tempt her.
In disaster, he's left his polishing rag
on the dance floor.
It's perfect for her nest.
She flies off without even seeing
his dance.
He delivers his berries too late.
He never got a chance to win her heart
and he lost his precious polishing cloth.
Back to work.
