Title: The Nile Crocodile vs Buffalo | Wild Africa | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijhjOfcIu1w


The Nile crocodile,
a creature older than Africa itself...
its hunting skills
honed over 200 million years.
Using extreme stealth, the crocodile
needs to get within a metre of its prey.
Desperate to drink,
the buffalo seem blind to the danger.
Just too much for a croc out of water.
But there'll be another chance.
