Title: Bear Gives a Warning Bite | BBC Earth

The better a person knows a bear,
the more they like 'em.
Because as you get to know 'em,
you get to realise
they're not the dangerous animals
we once thought
and, so, a person can get to feel close
to a certain bear,
but if you feel that way too quickly,
it could be just one action
on the bear's part destroys everything.
It's taken just a few weeks for me
to feel really connected with this family.
Lily...
are you interested?
But today, she doesn't come straight up
and take the greeting from my hand.
She's nervous about something. I think
it was a tree squeaking over there.
It's me, Lily.
A grape or two?
That's the deal. You and I,
we're going to be friends.
Yeah, we're going to be good friends.
I almost patted her there.
Just seems a natural thing to do.
Every time I see Lily, Hope plucks up
a little bit more courage.
I'm going to put my hand out
to your cub, is that okay?
Oh, no!
Wow, Hope.
That was the first time
I've touched your nose.
Oh, hello.
Are you coming closer?
Are you coming closer?
Hey... I don't really have to tell you
how magical this is,
because who in the world
wouldn't want to do this?
Okay.
Hey, girl. I'm sorry.
No, no.
I've just been bitten
for the first time by a bear.
Okay.
She just bit my leg.
It's okay. It wasn't a bite.
I was just looking up at Hope
when I wasn't keeping an eye on Lily
and what she was doing.
She just grabbed my leg with her teeth.
I wouldn't call it a bite.
It's not a bite. It's just a...
a warning, really.
Huh.
Funny how quickly it changes.
Okay, Lily. I don't have anything.
Good bear. Hey, bear.
Okay, that lip-smacking is her
letting me know that she's nervous.
I think, Lily, I am going to stand up.
Okay, bear.
Hey, Lily, I'm going to stand up.
Hey, girl, I'm just going to back away.
You're not too happy.
