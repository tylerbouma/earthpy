camouflage is unit rainy season a sloth
nets itself molding
each hair of the stove's fur is infused
with up to four species of algae in the
wet season these algae are green in the
dry season they turn brown the sloths
fur is home to numerous insects
including mites ticks beetles and moths
it's a veritable ecosystem as many as
120 moths live on a single sloth but the
host doesn't seem to mind the sloth must
make an unattractive meal it's all
insects fur and giant fermenting gut
imagine an infestation in a shag pile
carpet on top of a compost heap
