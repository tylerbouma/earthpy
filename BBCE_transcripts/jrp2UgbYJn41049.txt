Title: These Rats Can Detect Tuberculosis! | Extraordinary Animals | Series 2 | BBC Earth

Rats are clever animals.
They're easily trainable.
You can consider this as a rat school.
For the last three years, we are working
at rats being used
for the detection of tuberculosis,
which is very promising, in fact,
because on a weekly basis,
we pick out about ten patients
which have been missed in hospital.
TB kills half a million people
a year in Africa,
one and a half thousand everyday.
The rats could detect early signs
of the virus in human saliva.
Everytime they identify a positive sample,
the trainer's make a click sound,
and a food reward
of mashed banana follows.
These rats are at an early stage
of training
to get them used to the click sound.
This is the instrument that makes us
to communicate with the animal.
The moment when the animal hears
this sound means that it has to stop
what it is doing and then come for food.
They then have to learn
that sniffing in a hole
will lead to the click and reward.
After, the rat will know how to put
the nose in the hole.
Then it will be easy when I present
the sample in that hole.
And that is the way
how the rat learns the task.
There are further stages
to accustom the rats
to the smell of the virus,
and then to indicate
when they have smelt it.
Once this is done,
the rats know that a whiff of TB
results in a tasty treat.
The training at this rat school
is highly effective.
What would take a human scientist
all day to diagnose
takes the rats a mere seven minutes.
They're also extremely accurate.
We've got people now coming
automatically to us,
and can our rats...
"Can your rats test us for tuberculosis?"
Because they had heard it
in the newspapers and several places.
Our rats are picking out some cases,
which are missed
by the conventional methods.
So what makes a rat's sense of smell
so superior to a human's?
This is Bhanu Rao, a cheese shop owner
with a famous sense of smell.
I'm one of the best cheese noses in UK.
I have judged
three international cheese competitions,
and I judged
two British cheese competitions.
I am a cheese expert.
And this is Mandy the rat,
one of the Tanzanian rat school's
champion sniffers.
Mandy's nose makes
about eight sniffs per second,
compared to about two for Bhanu
and the rest of us.
This is a cheddar. This is Stilton.
It's a brie. It smells worse than a pig.
It is a smelly and wash-rind cheese.
Then this is a blue cheese, Galbani blue.
Goat cheese.
Whilst Bhanu is very good at identifying
types of cheese simply from their smell,
Mandy sniffs in stereo.
She can differentiate
two very similar smells
with just one sniff.
About one in every 100 of Mandy's genes
is given over to odor detection.
Poor old Bhanu has to make do
with one in every thousand.
From a droplet of urine
left by another rat,
Mandy can determine its gender,
sexual maturity and reproductive status.
Now, that's one test
we won't be trying on Bhanu.
