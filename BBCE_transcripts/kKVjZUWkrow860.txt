Big one.
Just seen a really good-sized
crocodile slide into the water
and I'm just trying to get a handle
on where it is.
It's even more gloomy and sinister now.
Oh, I see it, I see it.
I see a giant croc up ahead of us.
He is a true monster!
I'm having to do all I can...
...to keep my heart rate down.
The last thing I want is for him to sense
any fear from me.
It's a whole different scale.
It's probably...
...over 4 metres in length.
It could be four and a half.
This animal is standing up.
Menacing, threatening, alert.
I'm really not comfortable
being so close to him.
It's one of the most chilling experiences
I've ever had.
A crocodile of this size
could be 50 years old
and would have no trouble
taking an adult wildebeest or me.
This is the closest I've ever been
to lying alongside a dinosaur.
The massive male makes for the surface.
But simply takes a breath and heads
straight back down towards us.
It's coming after us.
It's following us along the bottom.
Big males battle
to dominate their territories.
He clearly sees us as a challenge.
We have no choice but to risk a dash
for the surface.
Well, that was, without a doubt,
the most frightening experience
I've ever had with an animal.
