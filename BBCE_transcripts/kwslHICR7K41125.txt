AZ is so clever that he can
communicate with Rob
using a new language system
devised specially for orangutans.
Let's start with an example
from the vocabulary.
This is the symbol for apple,
and you'll notice that it starts
with a rectangle on the outside
or the exterior, and all food symbols
start with a rectangle.
You notice there's a diagonal line
going from corner to corner
and a dot right in the center.
That is the only symbol
that will ever look that way.
And that's the only name
we'll ever have for Apple.
Right on cue,
in swings the star of the show.
Wanna start with these? Okay.
Well, sit up, so you're ready to go.
There you go, perfect. Good.
Rob uses an intercom system
to talk to AZ through the glass.
So, what we're going to do is
name this food, which is an apple.
You ready? Okay.
And he tells me when he's ready to go.
He'll just give a little tap on the glass.
He's ready for the next question.
You're doing great. I know it.
Okay, let's go.
Now, watch carefully, okay.
I'm going to ask him to find
the name for apple on his screen.
Perfect. Good job. Good, good, AZ.
That was exactly right and for AZ
that's a very simple screen.
At this point, he can work with screens
that are actually much more complex,
and I'll go ahead and ask him to use
one of the more complicated screens now.
Same food again, AZ. Okay, good.
Now, I'm going to show him
a very complicated screen.
Good. Very good, very good
Apart from food symbols like banana...
Perfect, Aze.
...grapes, crackers...
-Now watch.
-...and carrots...
There you go.
...AZ knows over 72 different words,
-Watch carefully.
-including objects like cups.
Excellent. Well done. Well done.
He even knows numbers and adjectives.
But perhaps
the most surprising language skill
is that AZ can use verbs and commands.
AZ can ask me or tell me
to open something,
when he uses that diamond-shape symbol
with the two lines inside.
You tell me what you want me to do
with this first container, okay.
Open, alright, good.
That was actually a very good choice
because there's a little something
in there.
For him, mistakes are actually quite rare.
He's into the high 90--Ready? Okay.
High 90% accuracy with all the symbols
that he works with.
AZ's astonishing accuracy demonstrates
not just a strong grasp
of syntax and vocabulary,
-but a razor-sharp long-term memory.
-That was spectacular.
