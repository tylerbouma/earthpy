could this be the remains of
one egg that he had found in one
particular spot
or were they perhaps pieces that he had
gathered from all over the place
there was only one way to find out to
try and piece them together
and the best method of starting seem to
be the same as you use
when you begin on a jigsaw puzzle to lay
out everything
face up on the ground
now would they fit together
these two certainly did
to fasten them temporarily i used
adhesive tape
with a jigsaw you at least know that all
the pieces belong to the same puzzle
and that they do go together somehow to
form a complete picture
but this was different much more
exciting and tantalizing
for i had no idea how much of the egg
was present
or whether all these pieces belonged to
one egg or to several
with mounting excitement i managed to
get piece after piece
to fit together
the egg began to appear even bigger than
i had imagined
at the end of an hour i had two halves
and to my joy they fitted together
perfectly
there were only three or four small
holes
and i still had several pieces left over
there was a place for even such a tiny
fragment as this
the egg was well nigh perfect
as i held it i had little difficulty in
imagining the country
as it must have been only a few hundred
years ago
when this riverbed was filled with a
brown
eddying flood and when great numbers of
gigantic birds over 10 feet tall
strode majestically through the swamps
most of madagascar's native trees have
been felled and replaced by plantations
of eucalyptus
imported from australia unfortunately
many of madagascar's animals
can't find the food they require in this
new and foreign environment
but even so the place was not totally
barren of animal life
dead logs to anyone looking for animals
are fascinating
objects you can never predict what
you'll find beneath them
giant millipedes perhaps snakes or here
in madagascar as always
something very special
so
you might think at first sight that
these small creatures are baby hedgehogs
but they're not babies for these are
fully grown and neither are they
hedgehogs
although they seem to resemble them so
closely they are a strange
extremely primitive creature called a
tenrec
and they live nowhere else in the world
but in madagascar
the local people have superstitions and
taboos connected with nearly all their
animals
and they have them about even such an
inoffensive little beast as this
many men particularly if they reckon
themselves to be brave and strong
are unwilling to touch them the tenrec
they regard as a cowardly creature
because when danger threatens it rolls
itself into a ball
so it stands to reason they say that if
they had much to do with it
they too might be infected by cowardice
we made quite a collection of ten wrecks
of several different species
which we brought back to london but
these two i'm especially fond of
because a month after we'd got them back
to the zoo to our surprise
they gave birth to these babies
unfortunately
the female was not a good mother and
killed several of her young
so it was decided to take the remainder
these two
away from her it was a difficult
decision to make
for you can never be sure how creatures
as young as these will take to a
substitute diet
the composition of milk there is quite a
lot from one kind of animal to another
and as no one as far as we knew had ever
bred ten wrecks before
the zoo had no previous experience to
work on
nor had they an analysis of tenrik milk
however
they fed these babies on cow's milk
greatly diluted with water
and sweetened with a little sugar giving
it to them to begin with from a pen
filler
fortunately they took it so successfully
that within a few days
they're developed enough to be able to
lap up milk when it was given to them a
few drops at a time
from a hypodermic syringe as they're
doing here
when they were first born their coats
were merely furry
but now after a week the bristles are
already beginning to thicken
into a tiny spines we had to go to their
main laboratories in the capital tanner
narev
and there i was privileged to see one of
the most remarkable creatures in the
world
the coelacanth until 1938
scientists only knew the coelacanths
from fossils and they believed that it
had become extinct over 60 million years
ago
then one alive and snapping turned up in
the trawl of a boat fishing off south
africa
it was a scientific sensation of the
century but infuriatingly
its internal parts had been destroyed in
spite of an intensive search it was not
until 1952
that another was found in the comoro
islands just off the coast of madagascar
it turned out that the common fishermen
caught one or two each year
but they didn't value them highly their
flesh wasn't particularly tasty they
said
and only their huge rough scales were
useful excellent for rubbing down the
inner tubes of bicycles
before mending a puncture but to the
scientists the sealer camp
was a paramount interest but it seems
certain that fish
very like it where the creatures from
which the whole of the amphibians
reptiles mammals and indeed man himself
are ultimately descended
every detail of its anatomy therefore is
of absorbing interest
its fins have long fleshy lobes at their
base
which make them quite unlike the fins of
any other living fish
and there seems little doubt that these
represent the first rudimentary legs
which enabled the ancestral amphibians
to drag themselves from the water
and begin the colonization of the dry
land a process that the
recently evolved little mud skippers are
now repeating
all over again on their own account
furthermore
when scientists examined the internal
organs of this strange creature
they discovered that it had the
beginnings of an air-breathing
lung if any animal in the world deserves
the
much used expression living fossil it's
surely this
this was different yet it must be the
voice of the endless it could be nothing
else
they were replying to their recorded
song with alarm calls
but where were they
[Music]
there 40 yards away farther than i had
guest
judging from the loudness of their calls
and 30 feet up in the tree
how close would they let me approach
huh
[Applause]
they were big creatures even larger than
i'd imagined
at least three feet tall and the tinny
voice of the recorder
seemed to hold them fascinated
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
huh
[Music]
the proportions of their body with their
very long legs
were strangely human and i remembered
once again
marco polo's dog-headed men
but then either the strange quality of
their recorded singing
or else my presence became too much for
them and they were off
jumping magnificently with their bodies
upright in a manner quite unlike that of
monkeys
we were in the territory where brown
lemurs live
they are becoming increasingly rare and
the madagascar government has passed
laws
making it illegal for them to be caught
but in the middle of the forest
we came across this trap the poachers
had made the clearing
and stretched these poles across it they
knew that the lemurs hate coming down to
the ground
and will certainly prefer to cross the
clearing by running along the poles
when they do they will enter this noose
and their hang
until they are slaughtered and eaten
there they were
uh
they were the size of small cats with
dark brown faces
and lighter brown fur and they showed
their anxiety
with their strange gruff cries
though they have hands and feet like
those of a monkey
the way they ran through the trees
reminded me not of a monkey at all
but of some quite different creature
like perhaps
a martin
their tails are not prehensile but they
seem to use them as a help in keeping
their balance
and they also wagged them when they were
annoyed or excited
uh
and here is a female with a young baby
clinging to her back
and having a pretty rough ride
brown lemurs nearly always produce only
a single baby
very rarely twins and never three or
more and you can quite see why
there just wouldn't be room
[Music]
there was a whole troop of them crossing
through the trees above our heads
we followed them and soon discovered
where they were going
to a mango tree for their afternoon feed
but in that position i didn't see how
the baby would get anything to eat at
all right
although most of them were feasting on
the yellow juicy mangoes
some were eating other things as well
this one
was stripping back from a young branch
and this one had found the nest of wild
bees
and was stealing the honey but all
lemurs are not brown
and this is the most handsome and
strikingly colored species of all
the magnificent ruffed lemur nearly four
feet long
now sadly increasingly rare
so
i know of no certain explanation for
this startling black and white coloring
so like that of a giant panda however
whereas the drab brown lemur is active
during the day
this rough lemur is mostly nocturnal
and many animals that only come out at
night are colored black and white
like the badger or the skunk perhaps
so that they can readily see and
recognize one another
when it's dark actually the coloring of
this creature
is very variable the markings are not
always the same shape
and sometimes the patches that are white
in this one are
in others a handsome reddish gold
the lemurs with their fox-like faces
and their human-like hands and feet
belong to the group of primates
the group which contains monkeys apes
and man himself but the lemurs are more
primitive
than any of these other families and
appeared much earlier
in geological history in fact millions
of years ago
there were many more types of lima than
there are found today
including a monster that was almost the
size of a donkey
which since it presumably had a long
fairy tale
must have been a really strange beast
but of all the surviving species
this is i think the most handsome
[Music]
