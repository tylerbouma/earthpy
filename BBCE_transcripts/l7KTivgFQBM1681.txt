washing men don't go exploring unless
you discover how the wonders got across
the river I think so if we find a path
we'll be heroes
imagine that liners wherever we go
they'll say there go those fearless
liars I wouldn't say I'm fearless to be
honest but I've got a good sense of
direction where are we I have no idea

it that way or that way that way is also
possible

adventure it's exciting why did I listen
