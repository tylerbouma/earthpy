Title: Birds Feast on Bee Swarm | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAbEtLmGFII


Gila woodpeckers
nest in holes they've drilled
in the trunks of giant cacti.
Cactus wrens and thrashers
like to build their nests
among as many spines as possible
to protect their chicks.
They're all waiting...
to cash in on the cactus bee gold rush.
For just a few days, thousands of bees
emerge from the ground to mate.
Males fight for females,
resulting in chaotic mating balls.
Food for everyone.
But where to start?
So many to choose from!
The birds use all sorts
of different tactics
to snare as many bees as they can.
A long bill certainly helps.
To succeed in this desert, you must
always be ready to seize the moment.
And why share?
In a matter of hours, thousands of bees
are caught to fuel the next generation.
