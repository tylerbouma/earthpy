Title: Swallows Searching for Water in the Deadly Sahara Desert |Africa | BBC Earth

This is the great Ubari Sand Sea,
in the heart of the Sahara.
These swallows have travelled 1,500 miles
since they left Nigeria.
Their superb powers of navigation
will eventually guide them to Europe,
but now they and other thirsty migrants
need to find a speck of blue
amidst this ocean of sand.
And here it is.
Umm el Mar.
Here too, ancient groundwater
wells up to the surface.
But the birds need to be careful,
for the sun has played a terrible trick.
This oasis is poisonous.
Intense evaporation
over thousands of years
has left the water saltier than the sea.
As if to underline the horror,
the place is infested
by vast swarms of flies.
But this plague is a bird's salvation.
The flies are filled with freshwater,
filtered from the brine.
So, like a desert wanderer
squeezing a drink from a cactus,
the birds get all the water
they need from the flies' bodies.
More and more migrants join in.
Wagtails.
This is the birds' only stopover.
It gives them enough fuel to escape
from the Sahara and Africa.
