Lions are mostly active at night
and seldom roar during the day.
We tried to persuade them to do so
with the help of scientists,
by playing back the roar
of a strange lion to a resident pride.
Even that didn't work.
But 12 years later, I set off
in an open-sided Land Rover
with the latest infrared technology
to try again.
As usual, they were sleeping.
I would have to wait for darkness.
We drive up. I go on one side,
the camera goes on the other.
And the lion starts roaring.
But the problem is,
I can't see where it is.
I can't even see where the camera is.
"Cue", says the producer.
So, I start trying to say my piece,
trying not to be too frightened
of this lion,
which is somewhere in the blackness,
as far as I can make out,
within a couple of yards of me
and no side on the Land Rover.
And I then had to do my piece to camera,
looking around,
see where on earth the camera was.
And now in the darkness,
there are a number of them roaring...
just around here.
There are two, I know, within...
three or four yards of where I am now.
And there's a third, perhaps
20 yards over there,
though it's difficult to tell,
because it's pitch black.
Those are not aggressive roars.
They are communication roars...
but they are quite enough to chill
the blood in the blackness of the night.
A few years later, similar technology
made it possible to film
one of the most extraordinary
hunting sequences ever recorded,
using whole batteries
of infrared lights mounted on vehicles.
A solitary lion stands no chance...
but the whole pride is here.
There are 30 of them
and they are specialist elephant hunters.
This remarkable behaviour could not
have been filmed in any other way
and it proved conclusively
what many others had doubted
that a big pride of lions
can indeed bring down
and kill an animal as big as an elephant.
