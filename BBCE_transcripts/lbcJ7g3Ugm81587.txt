because of the unique relationship we
had with talking in I was able to
move in close to share with them this

keep pinching myself to realize that the
Cubs were now all but living wild and
yet they allowed me to approach them
even at this sensitive moment a really
weird mixture of emotions because whilst
it's always upsetting to see anything

so much time with these cheetahs and
frankly hoping that they're going to be
successful this is such a major major
