Title: Leopard Learns How to Catch a Fish | BBC Earth

Even the river, normally a lifeline
for the animals, has almost disappeared.
Yet the mud soup that remains
could be concealing a free lunch...
if only the leopards can figure
out what it is...
and how to get it.
Are these weird apparitions
something to fear...
or a harmless
and much-needed source of food?
The mother has probably never seen
a live catfish before.
Eventually she loses courage.
Perhaps her son will be bolder.
He has spotted some fish of his own.
When they stop moving, though,
he seems not to know where they've gone.
It's the elephant
that finally reveals them.
You could almost see like
a lightbulb going on...
and, literally, right after the elephant
pulled out, he went straight in.
It was like playing
with soap in the shower.
He just sort of fumbled around
and didn't know what to do.
There's mud being splattered
on his body and on his face.
Finally he actually bit it,
which gave him a grip on it.
I just remember that expression
when he stood up.
He was so proud of his achievement.
He was quite stoked.
