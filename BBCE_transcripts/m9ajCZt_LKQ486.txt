Lot of tufted duck, aren't they?
Mainly tufted. Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Mate, that is unbelievable!
Look at that!
I'm really, really interested
in British wildlife,
so I've asked Chris Packham
on a nature date.
Cormorants, look, on the island.
Are they the cormorants?
Yeah, they're cormorants. Yeah.
Oh, my God. Yeah. It's something
different and I just think
people should learn about British
nature and stuff like that.
I'm hoping I'm going to see
some cool wildlife today.
Look, the pigeons are having a bath
there, look. Little pigeon spa.
Yeah, it is. Underrated, the pigeon.
He is going to be the best
possible person for this.
He's actually on TV
seeing British wildlife as a job.
Where we are now, I can't see there
being much wildlife about.
He's just asked us to meet him
in this caff in Tottenham.
It's made me a little bit
more excited, actually.
There might be some secret little
woods somewhere. I don't know.
Hello, Chris. Hello.
Oh, lovely to meet you. How are you?
I'm good, thank you. I'm good.
Ten minutes from here you can
see some pretty special stuff.
Can you really? I thought
a bit of urban bird-watching...
Nice! ..would be a good start.
Can't wait.
And we're going to go
to Walthamstow Wetlands.
Now, it's a site that's been there
for a long time, a series of old
reservoirs. Yeah.
It's a top spot to see
some pretty special species.
And in order to see it, I've got you
some binoculars. Thank you, Chris!
I never thought I'd be saying this -
"Chris Packham's given me a pair
"of binoculars," and I watch him
on TV. Only loaning them to you. Oh!
Also, a little checklist here of
some of the species we might see.
Hopefully, we'll pick up a few
extras as well. We can have
some extra cakes if we tick
all these off, can't we?
Well, in which case, I'm going
to tick them off whatever.
Let's get going.
You know when birds build their
nests, they use spit as well,
don't they? Some of them do.
Some of them use spider's web
to tie it together. Do they really?
Yeah, they do.
That's clever, innit?
Here we are.
Here we are. Been looking forward
to this. I've never been here.
No, honestly, I've told my mum
I'm meeting you.
It was like, "No way!"
But what about
this nature date, then?
I mean, I'm very pleased to get
the invitation. Yeah, I know.
I know, it's better
than a normal date.
I've always been massively into sort
of British wildlife especially
and I just thought you'd be
the perfect person.
I'm going to learn loads today.
I'll be telling facts to people for
the rest of the week. Anyway...
Look. Loads of other people, just...
They're on a nature date.
Yeah, they are.
Hello. Hiya. You all right?
I'm not sure they know they're on
a nature date. No, they don't.
But they are. They're on a nature
date. They don't know they are,
but they're on a nature date.
To get started bird-watching,
you do need a pair of binoculars,
and you can spend a lot,
but you don't need a flash pair.
You just need something to get
you started. Yeah.
A lot of people presume that
the most important sense
when you're bird-watching
is obviously vision... Yeah.
..because you're spotting them,
but, in fact, it's probably
your hearing.
Really? Yeah, because you can hear
things that you can't see,
obviously, if they're skulking
around down in the foliage.
And you pick it up quite quickly.
Some birds produce a very
characteristic call,
some are a little bit more tricky.
Magpie. The one that's just...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
..flown up into the tree.
Is that a little coot or moorhen?
I can't see. Coot, yeah.
Oh, I just saw
a great crested grebe as well.
Immediately to the left
of those, just on the bank.
It's in amongst some vegetation.
Oh, how did you see that?!
I think your eyes have
got super-zoom.
There's an expression
we use in birding, right?
It's, "Much about, then?"
Much about, then?
BOTH: Much about, then?
I can imagine it. Much about, then?
We all like telling each other
what we've learned
and what we've seen, even if we're
just bragging about it, you know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be terrible.
"You're not going to believe
what I've just seen!"
Squirrel there, look.
Yeah, yeah. See him up close.
I love squirrels.
Jack, I'm an honest bloke,
so I've got to tell you
the truth about something. Go on.
I didn't see a single episode,
not a single programme.
Oh, what, of Love Island?
Not one. Did you not?
And I'm the opposite. I've watched
all your programmes. I know.
I feel guilty now. Sorry.
You know, I've watched Springwatch,
Autumnwatch, you know,
The Really Wild Show. Yeah.
But do you know what? I don't...
I think you'd do well on it.
What...? Why?! I'll tell you what
it is. Ten weeks in a villa?!
Funnily enough, right, I used
to sit at the edge of the pool
on a beanbag and there's been
so many... On these beanbags,
you'd have conversations with girls,
arguments and stuff. There was
always drama on these beanbags.
But I used to sit on them, right,
and watch the birds
over the...over the mountains
and I used to watch, obviously,
the swifts and the swallows
come down and eat off the pool.
I'd see, like, birds of prey in the
distance and I used to love it,
so I sort of turned a little part of
it into my own little bird...
Bird-watching holiday? Yeah, little
bird-watching holiday. It was.
You just needed some binoculars.
No binoculars allowed.
Do you know what?
I'd love to have seen
the reaction of people.
Everyone unpacking their case,
yeah? And I just pop these out.
They'd go, "Right, he's not
coming in the girls' bathroom."
I'll tell you, honestly,
if I could see a kingfisher out
of today, I'd be over the moon.
I'm not giving up on the peregrine
yet, though.
Peregrines would be on there,
wouldn't they? Yeah.
Got to keep looking at these pylons.
Oh, my God! I've got it!
I've got it! I've got it!
Oh, my God.
Superb. That's brilliant.
So, that's the world's
fastest animal. Really?!
Yup. Speeds in excess of 200mph.
But how can you not find this
interesting? I love it.
Much about, then?
A little bit, yes. Yeah?
We've just seen
a peregrine up there.
There were a pair there
yesterday, actually. Oh, really?
CHRIS LAUGHS
So we lost out on that round,
I'm afraid. Yeah. Yeah.
I think cos probably
they didn't see any peregrines...
I really want to see the kingfisher.
Look, just here.
You see that fence post?
JACK GASPS
Just come down...
Oh, my God, I've got it.
Come down the wire from there.
Look at that!
Mate, that is unbelievable!
Look at that!
This is what I wanted to see today.
Oh, my God. Isn't he
a beautiful-looking bird?
Do you want me to tell you something
astonishing about that bird? Yeah.
There's no blue pigment
in that bird at all.
All of that is what
we call structural colour.
It's made by the way that the light
bounces through the feathers.
There's no pigment in there at all.
Really?! Yeah.
It just dived! Did you watch him
dive? Look, there he goes.
I can't believe I've just seen that.
I watched him dive.
That is amazing. I said that today
I wanted to see a kingfisher.
I can't believe I just spotted it.
We've had, right, mallard,
obviously, yeah.
Blackbird. We've had blackbird,
definitely, yeah.
Goldfinch...we've seen.
Goldfinch twice. Two of those.
Great tit, yes,
right at the beginning.
Now, I'm happy to say kingfisher.
Big tick and a smiley face
on that, mate.
Peregrine falcon, yes. Oh, yes.
So, we've, basically, done
all of them on that page
apart from one, and that's scaup.
But it's very rare. I've had a great
day today. I know. I've loved it.
You're hooked. I'm right in...
I'm hooked, I am.
I want to find the scaup.
I'm coming back to find that scaup,
I'm telling you.
But obviously, I want to carry on.
Have you got any more...?
Any more tips for me? I think that
the most important thing of all...
What? ..now you're hooked...
Yeah? ..is you've got to recruit
someone else.
I do. Because if I've recruited
you... Yeah. ..you've got to go
and recruit 1,000 people.
Shall we get a selfie?
Yeah, go on, then.
Let's get a picture down here.
It's very picturesque here. OK.
Lovely.
There we are. First successful
nature date. Excellent.
I've loved it. I've loved it too.
Thank you, Chris.
Great to meet a new enthusiast.
Oh, and I am. And I will find
that scaup. I will find it.
You're obsessed!
So, that was my first nature date,
so I want YOU to go
and ask somebody on a nature date.
Could be somebody you fancy,
could be one of your friends.
You can find romance in nature.
There's always something to
talk about.
You're not sitting opposite them
having a meal...
BIRD CALLS
See? Eye for nature. Heard that.
Oh, it's a coot. It's down there.
It's a coot. See, I know now.
Coot. I've learnt stuff today.
Use the hashtag #NatureDates
to give me
your suggestions on where
I should go on my next nature date.
I've really enjoyed this today.
