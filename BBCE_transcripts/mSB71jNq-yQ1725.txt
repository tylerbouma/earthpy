What bird has the most elaborate,
the most complex,
the most beautiful song in the world?
I guess there are lots of contenders
but this bird must be one of them.
The superb lyrebird of south Australia.
He clears a space in the forest
to serve as his concert platform.
To persuade females the come close
and admire his plumes,
he sings the most complex song
he can manage
and he does that by copying the songs
of all the other birds he hears
around him, such as the kookaburra.
It's a very convincing impersonation.
Even the original is fooled.
He can imitate the calls
of at least 20 different species.
He also, in his attempt
to outsing his rivals,
incorporates other sounds
that he hears in the forest.
That was a camera shutter.
And again.
And now a camera with a motor drive.
And that's a car alarm.
And now the sounds of foresters
and their chainsaws working nearby.
