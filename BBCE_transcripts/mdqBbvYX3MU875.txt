While our brains get swamped with
information about patterns and colour,
through Kali's eyes,
fast movement trumps everything.
As she stalks the flies, her eyes send
signals to the brain's visual cortex,
which analyses what's changed
between one picture and the next
up to 70 times every second...
faster than the human brain.
And a far bigger proportion of the neurons
in Kali's brain
are dedicated purely
to the detection of movement.
She almost can't help but pounce.
Cat's wild ancestors
relied on low-light vision...
and the ability to detect movement
to stalk prey.
But these evolutionary adaptations
have a downside.
Cats can't focus on anything closer than
around 30 centimetres in front of them.
But where their eyes fail them,
cats have another perfectly adapted sense
to go in for the kill.
The team have set up an experiment
to reveal just how
our cats' secret weapon works.
The camera can do in full HD resolution
up to 2,700 frames a second.
I would have thought
20 to 30 times will get it.
Also the camera...
John Bradshaw is hoping
these ultra-high-speed cameras
will capture this extraordinary
sensory organ in action.
It really is very, very quick.
I've seen still photographs
of it happening,
but there's nothing like actually
seeing the whole motion.
So, I think we got it there,
but it is very, very quick.
John's trying to observe
the cat's whiskers
as they move forward
into the attack position.
Let's just take the toy away
for a second and let's...
Can we have a look
at what we've just taken?
Okay, so here we go.
The cat realises
the mouse is within his grasp,
but he wants to know exactly where it is
in relation to his mouth.
Its eyes give up
because they can't focus very close.
That's where the whiskers take over.
So, what we can see here is the whiskers
suddenly being swept forward.
And now the claws are coming into action.
So, what we've got here, look.
The whiskers are pointing almost
directly in front of the cat's nose.
In fact, he's catching them with his claws
as he sweeps round
trying to catch the mouse.
But the little muscles
at the base of each whisker
are really tugging hard
to swing those forward
completely out of the normal position.
This is really extraordinarily detailed.
I'd never expected to see all of this.
It all seems to take place
in about a fifth of a second
which just shows
how fast cats' reflexes really are.
From the point where they sweep
the whiskers forward,
where the muscles contract,
and then relax back
and the whiskers spring back again,
the mouse doesn't have a chance.
Far thicker and longer
than normal hairs...
whiskers also sit three times
deeper in the skin
where they attach to nerve endings,
telling the cat how far each one
is being bent back and how quickly.
Their whiskers are
the same width as their body...
allowing cats to navigate
the narrowest spaces.
Cats also have whiskers above
their eyes and on their ankles,
sending them
a constant stream of information,
as they sense the world around them.
