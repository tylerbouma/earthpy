Nearer the coast,
there's water below and above ground.
The smell draws other animals,
prey and predators.
Baboons are opportunists.
They'll eat small mammals or insects,
eggs or even grass.
They soon spot a chance.
Newly hatched chicks
behind a pair of Egyptian geese.
For all the birds' bravery,
there's no contest.
Their attackers are 10 times
as heavy and much stronger.
Both parents try to head off
the baby snatchers,
but they can't protect every gosling.
Finally, a thief seizes one.
The parents try to locate any survivors.
At least one got away.
It's the youngest
that are the most at risk in any species.
