The character of the forest changes
as you descend, becoming ever darker
and damper, favouring different kinds
of animals and plants.
Less than two percent of the sunlight
reaches the floor,
but even here
there is extraordinary variety.
In the great island of New Guinea,
there are 42 different species
of birds of paradise,
each more bizarre than the last.
This forest is so rich
that nourishing food
can be gathered very quickly.
That leaves
the male six-plumed bird-of-paradise
with time to concentrate on other matters,
like tidying up his display area.
Everything must be spic and span.
All is ready.
Very impressive, but no one is watching.
The superb-bird-of-paradise
calls to attract a female.
And he has more luck.
But what does he have to do
to really impress her?
She retires to consider her verdict.
It's hard not to feel deflated
when even your best isn't good enough.
