Title: The 'Busy' Life of the Sloth | BBC Earth

In this tree, there is one
of the most extraordinary plant predators.
It's one animal
that I don't need to sneak up on.
Boo!
This extraordinary creature
is half-blind, half-deaf
and this is just about
as fast as it can move.
That's what can happen to you
if you live on nothing but leaves.
It's a sloth.
It's not exactly
an enthusiastic leaf-eater.
A couple of half-hearted chews
and the leaves go straight down
to its stomach.
Leaves, however, are not easily digested.
The sloth's technique
is to give them time.
Then, eventually, this mobile compost heap
pulls itself together
and starts on
a long and dangerous journey.
This is a very unusual sight,
a sloth in a hurry.
It wants to defecate and the only place
it is happy doing that, oddly enough,
is down on the ground.
It only does it about once a week...
but why does it come down
to the ground to do it?
And why does it nearly always choose
to do so in exactly the same place?
Whatever the reason,
it must be very important,
for a sloth on the ground
is almost helpless.
Any predator could attack it
and it doesn't have the speed to escape.
Why it comes down in this way
is a mystery.
Nobody knows.
Now it's finished and back it goes,
up to the safety of the canopy.
Leaves are not very nutritious.
The sloth's way of compensating for that
is not to eat more, but to do less.
Its claws hook over the branches,
so that the sloth can hang
without any effort of its muscles,
which have been reduced to thin ribbons.
And to save energy, it spends
most of its time hanging around,
half-asleep, in the tree-tops.
So with very little muscle
and a reaction time
only a quarter as fast as ours,
how does a sloth's day
compare with our day?
In the time it takes me
to write a few letters,
the sloth just about manages
to groom itself.
While we have our lunch,
the sloth nibbles a few leaves.
And then, as we film a sequence
for the series,
it's time for another nap.
