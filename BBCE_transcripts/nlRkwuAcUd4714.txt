It's called Darwin's bark spider
and the female has a remarkable strategy.
Like a real-life Spider-Woman,
she sprays strands of silk
in one long, continuous flow.
The threads fan out like a sail
and drift on air currents,
blowing across the water.
Every few seconds,
she crimps the strands together
to stop them spreading too widely.
The breeze will do the rest,
blowing the threads into a single line
and a 25-metre bridge.
Now she must reinforce her bridge,
because her web will hang from it.
But there's something bouncing
the line at the other end.
Another Darwin's spider is trying
to take advantage of her hard work.
She must deal with the intruder head on.
The cut line is an inconvenience,
but no more than that.
With hooks on the tips of each leg,
she gathers in the thread.
It won't go to waste,
as she'll eat it later.
When it's all reeled in, she sprays again.
Out streams
another 25-metre bridging line.
How a spider, no bigger than a thumbnail,
can produce so much silk so quickly
has baffled scientists.
And it's no ordinary silk.
It's the toughest natural fibre
on the planet, tougher than steel.
And it needs to be tough
to span the wide river.
With the bridge taut
and the ground anchor in place,
it's time to construct her trap.
These spiders can build
the world's largest orb webs,
up to two metres wide.
A few hours from the first spray
of bridging line,
the job is done.
Now her strategy is simple...
sit and wait.
And there's one final bout
of silk production...
shrink-wrapping her food for later.
