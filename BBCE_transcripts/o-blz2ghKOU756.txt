Title: Feeding Humphead Parrotfish | Blue Planet | BBC Earth

Humphead parrotfish,
nearly a metre and a half in length.
Their jaws are so powerful
they can bite through rock.
When they descend to feed,
the reef itself is under threat.
They are indiscriminate feeders,
taking both rock and coral alike
in their quest for algae.
These fish play a large part
in the erosion of the reef.
The rock and coral they swallow
emerges later as a fine sand.
On a single reef,
they can produce tons of it every year.
This soft sand forms the tropical beaches
that we find so alluring.
Over time,
the sand builds up to form an island,
which is then colonised
by animals and plants.
Trees take root.
Birds arrive.
The guano from thousands of terns
which have chosen to nest here
enriches the sandy soil,
which then can support more plants.
