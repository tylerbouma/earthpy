Title: Pearlfish's Gross Hiding Spot | BBC Earth

With hiding places at a premium,
fish will go to incredible lengths
to hide down here
and none more so than this.
The pearlfish is vulnerable
out in the open.
So, while not feeding,
it must conceal itself,
but it has a particular taste
in hiding places.
This is a sea cucumber,
which feeds on the sea floor.
Its body is basically a living tube.
It sucks in sand at one end,
extracts anything edible,
and passes waste out the other...
just what the pearlfish
has been looking for.
But not the mouth end.
It's drawn to the odour...
of the other end.
Sea cucumbers
are repulsive to most predators,
so the pearlfish is safe inside.
It'll stay there
until it's time to feed again.
It doesn't harm its host,
but the bad news for sea cucumbers
is that pearlfish are happy to share
their temporary home with others.
It seems there's plenty of room for all.
