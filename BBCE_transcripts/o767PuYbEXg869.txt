Title: Two Beautiful Humpback Whales Dance | Animal Attraction | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o767PuYbEXg


Male humpback whales repeat
each other's songs and add to them,
so they become ever more complex
and beautiful,
showing off their memory
as well as sheer volume.
Listening carefully to this song is
a female humpback whale.
She's here with last year's calf
and is ready to conceive another one.
He stopped singing and follows her.
He may sing to her again but not
if he thinks other males are close by.
They start to get to know each other.
It's an old-fashioned slow-motion waltz.
Such beautiful movement is rarely seen.
Dance in the animal world
is little understood.
But they're courting ballet
is about to become short.
Rival males have detected that something
is going on.
They arrive in force, a mob
on the dance floor set on disruption.
Each male tries to get beside the female
and to intimidate the others.
The 35-ton males are set on a fight.
Animals that can seem so tender
in a moment become so aggressive.
The mating game has become a battle.
They smash into one another.
They tail slap and batter.
Most of this is just show,
throwing their weight around.
It's over. The biggest male has won.
