These touch-me-not balsam have sprung up
to cover the woodland floor.
Each night the leaves go limp,
as the balsam exudes any excess moisture.
In the waterlogged soils
of the Lake District,
this is a handy adaptation
Soon their blooms unfurl.
As the petals
of these strange-shaped flowers drop off,
seed pods begin to form.
These pods are the favourite food
of the netted carpet moth caterpillar.
Although it was once thought
to be extinct,
the netted carpet moth
survives here in the Lake District,
its last remaining stronghold.
Touch-me-not balsam
is their only source of food.
These plants have a surprise in store.
Their seed heads...
explode.
It's how they became known
as touch-me-not.
But nobody told the caterpillars this.
The caterpillars have no warning
when these little bombs go off.
It's not just seeds that get hurled across
the forest floor.
