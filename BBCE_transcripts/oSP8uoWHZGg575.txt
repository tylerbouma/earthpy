Title: Deadly Predators of the Reef | BBC Earth

The soft corals
are one of the main reasons
that all this life is attracted
to the Yongala.
Almost every available space on
its once smooth hull is covered with them.
The soft corals are a refuge
for millions of small fish.
But they must dart out from time to time
to feed on the plankton in the current.
And, wherever small fish gather,
it's not long before something bigger
turns up to eat them.
Queensland groupers are real giants,
the largest bony fish on the reef
This Yongala resident
is as big as a small car,
which is why he's known locally as the VW.
His mouth's so big
he could swallow sharks and rays whole.
But another resident
has an even deadlier bite.
Sea snakes have more potent venom than
many of their land-living relatives...
and they put it to good use.
The olive sea snake doesn't really look
as if it's hunting,
but when its small head
disappears into a hole,
it can trap and paralyse
any fish hiding there.
It's unusual for so many predators to be
swimming so close to each other,
but there's so much to eat here.
Most of the action is on top of the wreck,
where the strongest currents
sweep in the most food.
For the small fish that live here,
to venture into the blue water
is a huge gamble,
but they've got to do it to feed.
If they get it wrong and go too far,
that can mean the difference
between life and death.
The amount of marine life
to be found in the hundred meters
of the wreck of the Yongala
is truly staggering.
Arguably,
it's a greater concentration of life
than on any spot
on the Barrier Reef itself.
