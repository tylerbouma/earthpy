Title: Panda Doesn't Realise She's Had Twins! | BBC Earth

It has been 18 days
since Li Li gave birth.
For her to produce twins is not unusual.
Half of all panda births result in them.
But for both twins to survive,
certainly is.
Pandas almost always abandon one cub.
It's thought that they don't have
sufficient milk or energy to care for two.
But the team at Chengdu
have hit upon a cunning plan.
By removing one cub at birth
and then switching them
throughout the day and night,
keepers are able to encourage
panda mothers to feed both siblings,
while being under the impression
that they have only one.
Li Li is distracted
with a bowl of honey water,
but is reluctant to give up her cub.
Doing this successfully requires
enormous patience from the keeper
and great trust from the panda.
One twin is taken to the incubator
where it will have a top-up
of formula milk,
and switched with the other, which will
now get his share of his mother's milk.
The keeper will swap the twins
up to ten times a day.
And Li Li will almost always
have one cub with her.
Chengdu's technique of twin-swapping
at last opens the way
to a possible 100% survival rate
in new-born captive cubs.
