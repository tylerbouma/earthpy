at the Dolphin Research Center in brassy
Key Florida it's a nonprofit making
research facility is the Dolphins
natural behavior things that they do
just for fun that we've even seen wild
dolphins doing leaping out of the air
actually some species of wild dolphins
do flips just for fun what we do as
trainers when we see our dolphins doing
that is try and blow our whistles which
says perfect and the Dolphins get all
excited and go oh they like that yeah
and we try and put it on a signal so we
can ask them for it again one of the
trainers Lindsey would let me into the
secret of how to communicate using hand
signals first you get their attention
you don't do it yeah then you're gonna
show them that okay sign and say circle
okay get both of their attention go
chase and I'm good do it with one hand

gonna go out over here somewhere well

favorites is that oh yeah yeah you can
