The trauma of attack
can initiate another hypnotic state.
These pigeons are in a state of trance.
A bizarre condition that affects
many different animals.
Alligators are easily mesmerised, too.
A fact exploited by Florida showmen.
Avoid the teeth and it's easy to provoke
this weird catatonic state.
The alligator reacts as if it had been
grabbed by another predator.
A chicken can be hypnotised too
by turning it over
and focusing its attention.
These strange states
probably originated as a defence.
Predators react to movement.
If their quarry plays dead,
the killer instinct is suppressed
It's this inborn defence that's triggered
when people hypnotise animals.
In trance, breathing and heart rates drop.
They can stay like this for hours.
When they come to it's as though
a hypnotist has clicked his fingers.
They even wake together.
And they don't remember a thing.
