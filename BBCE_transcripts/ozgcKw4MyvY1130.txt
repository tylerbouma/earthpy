Meet Griffin, the star
of the Avian Learning Experiment,
an experiment to prove
that parrots are capable
of more than just parroting.
Good birdy.
Griffin's human partner in the experiment
is Dr. Irene Pepperberg.
We started to establish a two-way
communication system with a bird
that would allow us then to use
that system to examine his intelligence.
Through this two-way communication
with Griffin,
Dr. Pepperberg is unlocking
the secrets of the bird brain
and showing just how much
a parrot can understand.
Hi. Hi, sweetie. Hi.
For the past 12 years, Griffin
and Dr. Pepperberg have worked together.
Let's go check the email first, okay?
Can we go check email first? Yeah? Yeah?
Griffin is a little bit cautious,
a little bit watchful.
Griffin is an academic bird
who doesn't mince his words.
-What do you want?
-I want to go back.
You want to go back? Okay.
He means what he says
and he says what he means.
We're going to do some matter, okay?
Tell me what matter.
-Paper.
-Paper, that's right.
Good birdie. There you go.
Dr. Pepperberg's simplified language
uses the minimum number of words possible.
So instead of asking,
"What is this made of?" she asks...
What matter?
-Wool.
-Good boy.
Griffin can also understand
abstract concepts
and even has the ability to use numbers.
Now listen.
How many?
-Four.
-Four is right. Good boy.
But Griffin has plenty of competition
for the title of genius parrot.
His main rival has flown in from Tennessee
to give a special performance
at a top Boston nursery school.
-Would you like to hear her talk?
-Yeah.
-Can you tell everybody your name?
-Einstein.
This is Einstein. Now, Einstein,
can you tell everybody "hi"?
-Hello.
-That's nice. Can you be more polite?
-Sweetheart.
-That's pretty sweet.
Now before we start, Einstein,
do you need to clear your throat?
Irene has come to see Einstein firsthand
because she's heard
of her impressive vocal abilities.
Now Einstein just took a trip
all around the world.
Well, in Africa,
there's a lot of chimpanzees.
Can you do a chimpanzee?
How about a pig?
What about one that needs to go on a diet?
Can you sing?
But today was a very special day
for Einstein because it was her birthday.
-What would you do if you got a peanut?
-Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Even though Einstein's ability
to mimic is impressive,
Irene still thinks that Griffin is
top of the class
when it comes to comprehension.
