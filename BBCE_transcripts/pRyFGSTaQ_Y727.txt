Title: Sailfish Are Master Hunters | Planet Earth | BBC Earth

Sailfish, three metres long,
are closing in on prey.
They will only use just enough energy
to make their kill...
never wasting a fin stroke.
Nearly 100 sailfish have surrounded
a single school of bait fish.
It's very rare to see so many
of these hunters in one place.
To herd their prey, the predators
raise their huge dorsal fins.
A mistimed strike by one sailfish
could fatally damage another.
But each continually changes its colour
from blue to striped to black.
That warns its companions
of its intentions
and also confuses the prey.
As the shoal is driven nearer the surface,
it comes within the range of the seabirds.
Out here in the open ocean, there is
nowhere for the bait fish to hide.
Sailfish live a high-octane life.
To survive, they must find prey daily.
So, their entire existence
will be spent on the move.
