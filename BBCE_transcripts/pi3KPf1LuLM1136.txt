These wolves are taking their time
to get used to the crew and me.
This is really interesting.
As they're approaching,
they're kind of chatting to each other.
Just kind of figuring out who's going
to be the first to be allowed,
probably to come in
and talk to Tess not to me.
Hi.
Hello. Hello.
Wow.
Okay. Now they're starting to build up
their confidence.
They're still playing around
with each other.
There's still definitely some nerves
going on.
The fighting and the nipping
and the scratching and the biting,
it all has a real function
of keeping the team together
and keeping everyone
in their right positions.
It also gives you a really good look
at those teeth.
The canines are huge... utterly ferocious.
Wolves have a bike twice as strong
as our German Shepherd police dog.
Tess knows each wolf
and their different personalities.
As they come closer,
they greet her by licking her face.
Although they might seem very much
like domestic dogs,
these wolves are still wild animals
and our movements
have to be slow and cautious.
As they approach,
they're very much being led
by that canine super sense... smell.
You can see what comes in first...
always the nose,
always sussing things out
with that incredible sense of smell first.
Two thousand times
more powerful than ours.
That phenomenal sense of smell
is used to track prey
from over a mile away in the wild.
They're gradually starting to get
more and more confident,
checking out Nick the sound man
and Johnny the cameraman,
getting closer and closer.
But as they approach I mustn't let myself
forget how deadly these animals really are
and the wolves are quick to remind
me who's in charge.
Go on. Look.
I think I might have moved
a little bit too fast there
and just got snapped at.
Just to show there's nothing in my hands.
Wow.
It was just a just a... just a nibble,
but even so as individuals,
wolves are awesome predators.
But it's when they come together as
a pack that they are really deadly.
The way they bring themselves together,
particularly before a hunt,
is using a howl
and we're going to try that now
and see if we can get
these guys to join in.
-Shall we give it a go?
-Give it a go.
It's working.
The howl can be heard by other wolves
over six miles away
and also acts as a warning signal
to rival packs to stay away.
And what a wonderful, eerie,
chilling, stunning sound!
