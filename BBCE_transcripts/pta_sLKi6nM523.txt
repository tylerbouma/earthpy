Title: Eternal Adversaries: Lions and Hyenas | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pta_sLKi6nM


As the heat of the day wanes,
animals become more active.
After sunset there's a drop in temperature
of about ten degrees...
and that's a cue for the night hunters
to venture out in search of a meal
When the night filming crew
arrived on the scene
of the buffalo kill found earlier,
the lion pride male had shown up.
He's the only mature male in the group.
He's about seven years old
and has been fitted with a radio collar
by the Zambian Carnivore Programme.
He's a big cat, probably over 200 kilos.
And one of his most important roles
is to defend the pride and territory
against competitors.
Hyenas are top of the list,
when it comes to a lion's enemies.
A large clan of hyena have been attracted
by the scent of the buffalo kill.
All the adult lions,
including the females,
do their best to keep
these would-be thieves at bay.
Here the thermal cameras
show one of the pride lionesses
chasing off a lone hyena.
Then suddenly the pride male catches
one of the hyenas off-guard
and stamps his authority
in brutal fashion.
With the breaking dawn,
all but one of the hyenas has retreated.
But even the injured individual
won't give up.
Amazing dramas here.
There's absolutely no love lost
between these two eternal adversaries.
And still the hyena lives.
And I'd love to be able to tell you
that the reason
for a lion attacking a hyena is simply
to defend its meal, but you know what?
Truth is, lions are pretty brutish
and they will try and grab
and kill just about anything,
whether it's a predator or otherwise.
If it doesn't represent a meal,
they just leave it.
If it does, of course they eat it,
but in that way,
in a pretty violent fashion...
they absolutely are top of the tree,
when it comes to the predators out here.
Beggars belief, doesn't it?
How can an animal survive...
being suffocated, effectively,
by a male lion and still be breathing?
Not just breathing,
but have the will to live...
that is so keen that it gets up
and it goes.
Only a hyena... Only a hyena.
You may not think they're beautiful,
but my goodness,
you've got to respect them. You've got to.
