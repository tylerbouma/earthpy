Title: Tiger Grieves Her Dead Mate | BBC Earth

Baghani's ready to mate again.
She's spent all morning
calling for Rajore.
But so far there's no reply.
When he doesn't appear for three days,
we all join the search.
Picking up his trail...
following his footprints.
We're all worried.
And then we find him...
dead.
Not killed by poachers...
but poisoned by a villager,
protecting his cattle.
But Baghani doesn't know her mate is dead.
She's still searching for him.
She can smell him, but he's gone.
She cries for three days after his death.
We are both heartbroken.
