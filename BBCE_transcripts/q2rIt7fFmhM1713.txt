Kevin has been with them
since they were cubs.
They like the smell of him.
-They love to do that.
-Me...
-Oh, my God.
-...not so sure.
Get in there.
-Napoleon.
-Put your face right there.
-Hey.
-There he is.
What's it gonna be like
with me though?
Are they gonna accept me
or how am I gonna...
-Well...
-I don't want that.
-No, we're gonna take it step by step.
-Yeah.
And I know them fortunately well enough
to see how they react to you.
Hello, my boy. Hello, my boy.
Hello, guys. Hello, Napoli.
They do like their pampering.
You love your job, don't you?
Absolutely. Wouldn't have it any other way
-Oh look at that.
-Look at those claws.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey.
If it goes wrong, worst case scenario.
just so I know, you know.
Do I stand a chance?
-If two lions decide to gang up on you...
-Yeah
-...and take you down, no, you don't.
-Thanks, Kevin.
Well, here goes.
-Welcome to Napoleon and Tau's den.
-House, yeah.
-Alrighty.
-Okay, yeah.
Already feels very strange.
-On the other side of the fence.
-On the other side of the fence.
I think we're gonna leave Tau
for the time being.
-He's gotta bone in his mouth.
-Okay.
So we're gonna approach Napoleon,
who looks pretty...
-He looks relaxed now.
-Yeah.
-He looks more relaxed than I feel anyway.
-Napoli.
For nature's extreme fighters,
intimidation is just as important
as actual fighting.
It's better to scare off a rival
than risk death in battle,
and believe me,
I was definitely feeling intimidated.
-Pet him.
-Pat him?
-Yeah, that's half-hearted, I know.
-Yeah, that's half-hearted.
Let's just let him...
let's see what he's doing.
Okay, he's gonna try a little...
-Love tap.
-...love tap.
Yeah, he's checking me out.
When he fixes you with those eyes,
you just can't help...
-It's quite intimidating.
-It is, yeah.
-All right.
-Napoleon's on a hair-trigger.
He could go from kitten to killer
in an instant.
He's a bit mental.
-You expect a bit of a reaction.
-Yeah.
He's well aware of you.
He knows exactly where you are.
I can see he's not tightly relaxed
because that tail keeps on giving
a sort of a flickering on again,
-and there's no flies around.
-Yeah.
He's probably woken up
on the wrong side of his bed this morning.
Okay, that's not something
you want to be telling me
while I'm here.
I was getting the feeling
that if Napoleon could see
a window of opportunity, he'd nail me,
which was a bit distracting.
To be honest, I'd completely forgotten
what I'd come to find out.
Oh, yeah. I remember.
So what is it for you that makes
the male lion
the perfect fighting animal then?
The sheer size of this forearm.
It's thick right from the forearm
all the way down to the paw.
So even without claws,
you've got this huge paw pad
that can give you a whack.
Add to that, four razor-sharp claws,
huge fangs,
two sonars as ears,
telescopic sights as eyes,
and an incredible sense of smell.
Kevin had warned me
the lions weren't quite themselves.
They're not the calmest of lions today.
Something was wrong
and it was time to leave...immediately.
Let's face the lion.
We're pushing our luck.
Never turn your back on them.
Out you come.
I was scared ****less,
and that's absolutely no word of a lion.
I don't mind admitting it,
and I think I'd be crazy if I wasn't
