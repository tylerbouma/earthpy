Title: Why Are These Fish Beaching Themselves? | BBC Earth

Gulf grunion scout the beach.
Then, in their hundreds,
females surf in on the waves,
shadowed by eager males.
They are here to spawn.
But it's not going to be easy.
Each female tries to propel herself
as high up the beach as she can
to lay just beyond the reach of the waves.
Drilling herself into the sand is the cue
for the male grunion to move in.
They wrap themselves around her,
jostling to fertilise the eggs.
In the frenzy, many eggs are dislodged.
Once flicked out of the sand,
they won't survive.
Although these fish out of water
might seem vulnerable,
the mass of flickering bodies
confuses predators.
The greatest danger
comes as they wriggle back to sea.
This is the moment
the pelicans have been waiting for.
Slightly deeper water means
they can get their bills underneath
to scoop out their victims.
This female runs the gauntlet
and makes it through.
Her eggs will develop quickly
in the warm desert sand
and be ready to hatch in two weeks,
on the next spring tide.
