The abundance of krill
attracts other visitors
to the peninsula in the summer.
Antarctic minke whales.
Their pointed heads and short dorsal fins
give them speed and endurance.
And they need both.
There are other whales here, too.
Killers.
This is an extended family
of mothers and their young.
And a male with a huge dorsal fin
almost two metres high.
A lone minke whale.
It's just what this group
of killer whales are looking for.
Working as a team,
as they have done for decades,
they fan out across the strait
in search of their quarry.
And they've found it!
The minke races away,
pursued by outriders on each flank.
Terrified, the minke heads for the shore.
It's so desperate to escape,
it almost beaches itself.
It makes a desperate break for freedom.
Two hours and 20 miles later,
the minke is still alive
and swimming strongly.
Its only real defence is its endurance,
but the killers work as a team,
with fresh ones replacing
the outriders in relays.
And as the minke tires,
the battering and the biting begins.
Seabirds are attracted by the smell
of fresh blood rising from the water.
The killers try to flip the minke over.
If they can manage to keep
its blowhole underwater, it will drown.
One forces the minke's whole body
down below the surface.
And then, the final strike.
The team drag the minke under
for the last time.
And the hunters, finally, can feed.
