this larger male is the trees owner and
Draco's don't share the owners flag is a
warning trespassers
won't be tolerated the owners not only
intimidating he's prepared to battle
a dead end
safety is a long way away now he must
choose fight
hopefully
only in the jungle do you find lizards
that can soar like dragons
he can travel over 100 feet in a single
leap it's a very fast and efficient way
to move through the jungle
maybe this new tree will have food and
no resident owner
you
