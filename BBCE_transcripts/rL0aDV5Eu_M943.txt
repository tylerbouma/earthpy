angry with us

nasty needle again I wish I could
explain to them it's for their own good
okay that's a that's a lowered rear leg

moment to rid the den site of evil
spirits the Nez Perce believed man and
nature are one and the same when you die
you return to nature and that means to
them these bears are our ancestors
we want to ask creator to protect these
bears and we have summons in the spirit
world
to acknowledge that they are here we ask
grandfather that you'll guard over this
door and that you will not let evil come
to this place that's you out yet
