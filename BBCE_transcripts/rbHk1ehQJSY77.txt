in earth's long history
it's been through at least five mass
extinction
events most
were caused by cataclysmic volcanic
eruptions
it's not the lava or ash that wiped out
life
but an invisible gas released by
volcanoes
called carbon dioxide
co2
is thought the greatest of all these
events
warmed the planet by as much as 10
degrees celsius
and led to the loss of around 90 percent
of all life on earth
humanity is now acting like a super
volcano
releasing carbon dioxide at an even
greater rate
than the prehistoric mega eruptions that
extinguished life
in the past
