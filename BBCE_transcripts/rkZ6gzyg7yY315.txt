a European ham stuffed
[Music]
wild hamsters are found in grasslands
throughout Central Europe here in the
city they're doing extremely well this
male is on a mission to find food the
coast looks clear but best not take any
chances the trick is to get in and out
before your court
and now desert temple wax it's full of
oil and high in calories
[Music]
hamsters cheeks can hold a quarter of
its body weight
just one more mouthful oh dear
big jinx and narrow bottlenecks are very
embarrassing
[Music]
mission accomplished
