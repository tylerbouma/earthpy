Title: The Lung Fish | Nile | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0JdbWwLWgQ


this is a fish a lung fish it's been
cocooned in mud and mucus underground
for months waiting for the waters to
rise primitive lungs allow it to breathe
air as it searches for the nearest pool
but reaching water doesn't mean safety
the Shoebill stork
is a giant of the swamp well over a
metre tall if bizarre beak is perfectly
designed for feeding in muddy water
where prey is difficult to target a huge
beak increases the chance of success
[Applause]
it's surprising what a muddy pool can
hide
