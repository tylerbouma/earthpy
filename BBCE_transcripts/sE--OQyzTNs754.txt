The effect of the turning tide
can be totally different on a rocky shore.
Here, on the coast
of Vancouver Island in Canada,
the sun bakes the exposed rock.
It's virtually impossible to dig
underground when the sea retreats,
so, these mussels and barnacles
are fully exposed to the heat of the sun,
literally cooking in their own shells.
And the seaweed simply dry to a crisp.
It can be a wait of many hours
before the water returns.
Throughout each month, the size
and the strength of the tide changes.
The biggest tides of all happen
when the gravities of the sun
and moon pull in unison.
That happens
immediately after the new moon...
and again after the full moon.
These are called the spring tides.
They reveal vast tracts of seabed
that would normally be covered.
For these raccoons,
it's a chance to look for a seafood feast.
A mother ventures forth with her kits.
With the spring tide,
they've come further down the beach
than smaller tides would normally allow.
Searching with their extraordinarily
sensitive paws,
they look for suitable prey.
With the extreme low tide,
they could find something special.
And what could be better
than a red rock crab?
That is, if it weren't for the risk
of a painful pinch.
With large crabs,
there's no substitute for experience.
The mother makes an expert's catch.
But the kits learn fast.
And for those that don't,
begging is always worth a try.
All too soon, the returning tide
will cover the raccoons' table.
For all the invertebrates,
it's a welcome relief,
but in rough weather they are exposed
to the worst of the waves.
