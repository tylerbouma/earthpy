distractions all around them are
extraordinary creatures each little
coati must learn which creatures are
safe and which are dangerous southern
lapwings
are good to have around they follow the
coatis to pick up small bugs the family
disturbs as they forage in return they
keep an eye out for predators armadillos
can usually be ignored so can giant
anteaters
but a Savannah who is a different matter
