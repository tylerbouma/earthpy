It returns to the place
where it last left its chick
in the hope
that it might still be close by.
But chicks tend to wander
so, the adult has to call to it.
The chick responds
and they slowly home in on one another.
The plaintive entreaties of the chick
stimulate the adult
to regurgitate a mouthful of fish.
With the return of one parent, the other
is free to go to sea to feed for itself.
Aware of the leopard seal's presence,
the penguins press together
at the ice edge,
unwilling to be
the first to risk diving in.
Occasionally, the seal comes out
on to the ice and attempts to grab one.
But its most successful strategy
by far is to lie in wait.
It hides behind a corner of ice.
The emperors gain confidence
and make a dash for it.
The first wave of penguins escape.
Once in open water, they will be safe.
But the seal is alerted by the noise
and through the mass of bubbles,
it makes its attack.
Almost invariably, it makes a kill.
Encouraged by the absence of the seal,
the remaining penguins
make a break for the open sea.
In time, their chicks will fledge.
And when the Antarctic autumn
is near its end,
these adults will walk across
the newly-formed ice,
to endure yet another winter
on the frozen sea.
