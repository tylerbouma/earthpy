Title: Wolves Defend Pups from a Bear | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soe-mONHGMc


You can see how the younger wolves
are excited by the arrival
of their father, Storm.
These younger wolves are his pups
from previous years,
in fact, they still lick at his mouth
to be fed,
like they did when they were small.
It's so rare to see this,
I feel very lucky.
But then my eye in the sky
spots a black bear approaching the den.
I see it before the wolves do.
They don't realise
the approaching threat,
While the black bear would be
hard-pressed to take on an adult,
it could be after the pups.
Every time the bear tries to go
into the trees where the pups are,
Storm bites him in the rear,
forcing the bear to turn back to face him.
By working together,
a combination of pushing from behind
and leading him on,
Storm and his offspring
get the bear away from the den.
I think that bear is just as happy
as the wolves to be out of there.
