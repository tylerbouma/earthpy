[Music]
the rainforests of eastern australia
are the stage for perhaps the sneakiest
criminals of the lord
[Music]
this is the satin bower bird a creature
with a bad case of kleptomania
it doesn't stop at weaving twigs he
likes home decor too
blue is his favorite color bottle tops
nicked from a nearby campsite
are his proudest possessions
he has an eye for detail too placing
them precisely for
maximum visual impact
she makes all the right moves entering
the bower to show
she's interested a ring
makes the perfect gift
not impressed
how about a bouquet of flowers
but something's not quite right
the penny drops he's been duped
this isn't a female at all it's a young
male
in disguise and he's here to steal
he's part of a gang of juvenile
delinquents ruling the forest
tricking unwary males
in their hideout they display their
ill-gotten gains
it takes up to seven years for a male
bower bird to reach maturity
in the meantime they practice making a
bower
and dancing for each other
but they can never have too many blue
trinkets and bling
time to go out stealing again
and bowers don't come more decadently
inviting
than this but this is no ordinary bower
it's occupied by a male spy bower bird
and adorned with an irresistible array
of blue treasure
and dual cameras all perfectly placed
to catch the thieves in the act
professionals they approach with caution
once again they pretend to be courting
females
this time they work together one
distracts
as the other steals the jewels
spy bowerbird can only observe as they
clean out the bower
gem by precious gem
back home with their stolen goods they
continue to practice their courtship
techniques
but spy bowerbird isn't off the hook
the male bower bird who was their first
victim
needs to replenish his bower well
if you can't beat them you may as well
join them
[Music]
sand martins fly from south africa just
to nest in the banks of this river in
hungary
they are here for the abundant insect
life but as their chicks grow
demand outstrips supply
but in their time of need the river
provides a perfect banquet
one by one they emerge
[Music]
they are mayflies
their moment of glory lasts just three
hours
just time enough to mate and lay eggs
they are a superfood for the hungry
[Music]
chicks
[Music]
[Music]
as the day ends the mayflies perform
their swan song
the sand martins are so full they lose
their edge and appetite
but their loss is another's gain
living in the grounds of a hawaiian
hotel is a night heron
[Music]
the staff call him hank
his home is an all-inclusive resort
where food
is literally thrown at you
[Music]
but hank always has trouble going up
against the larger swans
when he finally does get his beak on
some food he does something completely
unexpected
he doesn't eat it but
instead appears to have a plan
[Music]
hank takes the bread
he places it in the water
[Music]
and he waits
[Music]
he could eat it at any time
but he doesn't
[Music]
that wasn't part of the plan
two fish in a single mouthful
hank is catching fish by using the bread
as a tool and he clearly knows how
valuable
it is he doesn't waste it on fish too
big for him to eat
but instead takes it out of harm's way
food is so scarce that more than two
adults are needed to search for it
if a nest full of chicks is to be kept
supplied
this bird is not the parent of these
nestlings
it's one of last year's chicks who has
stayed on to help raise this year's
brood
young female helpers after a year or two
usually leave to look for territories of
their own
but young males may stay on for as long
as seven years
one of them may eventually inherit the
family estate and nesting site
when the old breeding male dies but most
will never father a brood
instead of producing their own young
they find their reproductive reward
in helping to raise their younger
brothers and sisters
[Music]
guarding the food supply is just as
important as collecting it
and some of the young helpers act as
sentinels
keeping an eye out for thieves
this is a trespasser from a neighboring
territory sneaking in to try and steal
food
that can't be allowed
[Music]
[Music]
back to normal duties
another intruder an indigo snake
it too is hungry and the meal it is
searching for
could well be a jay chick
shhh
shhh
so teamwork saves the nest
indeed as a result of studies here we
now know for certain
that pairs with teams to help them are
very much more successful in rearing
their young
recently though it's been discovered
that this form of cooperation is quite
widespread among birds
some species of wrens and woodpeckers
and moorhens
all use this form of cooperation under
some circumstances
as indeed do some mammals
one that involves a very talented pod of
dolphins
they are closely watched by a flock of
great egrets
who have become experts on the dolphins
behavior
[Music]
[Music]
their queue is the moment a dolphin pops
to the surface
checking the position of the nearest mud
bank
[Music]
the egrets are poised and ready for
action
then it happens
the dolphins drive the fish hole ashore
as the fish flounder the dolphins scoop
him up
but the egrets also pile in
this is the only place in the world
where dolphins strand feed like this
and the local birds have learned to make
the most of it
strangely the dolphins always use their
right sides to push ashore
the young dolphins pick up this
technique from their parents
as do the egrets that follow them
many no longer fish for themselves and
totally rely upon the dolphins cast offs
the egrets are living proof of bird's
extraordinary ability to adapt to the
opportunities on offer
