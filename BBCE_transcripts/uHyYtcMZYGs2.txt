[Music]
to help her in her quest
she's equipped with three super powers
first an amazing approach to getting
about
[Music]
porsche is a jumping spider
able to leap up to 50 times her own body
length
[Music]
nowhere seems beyond her reach
next her second superpower superb
eyesight
[Music]
essential if she's to distinguish her
prey
in all this clutter
because her prey doesn't stray
porsche is a spider-eating spider
this raises a few problems her lunch
is three times her size
[Music]
packed with venom and surrounded by
a sticky trap
mission impossible not at all
because of her third superpower
porsche is a genius
she can map her world in three
dimensions
[Music]
and formulate a plan of attack
[Music]
she can have an idea
[Music]
the web builder is blind
it won't have a clue that she's coming
[Music]
right on target and safely behind those
fangs
but a mind as active as porsches can
always do
with more brain food
[Music]
here there's no anchor point for the
abseil
but porsche has another idea
instead of going to the spider
[Music]
she will bring the spider to her
she plucks the strands to imitate
struggling prey
[Music]
drawing the spider in
[Music]
to its death
[Music]
spider silk with the scent of a female
he just needs to follow it
wherever it leads him
[Music]
[Music]
other males have gone on the same quest
and have come
to a grizzly end
[Music]
here's the female and she doesn't look
very amorous
in fact she kills every male who doesn't
match up to her expectations
[Music]
what can he do to win her over
[Music]
dance
[Music]
dance for his life he will need a
show-stopping trick
to avoid becoming lunch
[Music]
with his fan unfilled he begins an ever
more complicated series of dance moves
to try and seduce her
[Music]
at last she succumbs to his advances
and allows him to mate with her
he matched her expectations
[Music]
but she kills him anyway
right here's one hey
now that is a trapdoor spider
now these spiders are amazing
they live permanently inside a soaked
line tube
and they just make a little lid out of
debris and
soil and silk and it fits absolutely
perfectly onto that hole
hidden behind the trapdoor the spider
detects its prey through ultra-sensitive
hairs on its legs
when it feels vibration it springs the
trap
so if i get a stick and i just
lever it up you can see
yeah in there you see it now he's in
there okay
so he he's gonna wait until an insect
crawls past all we're gonna do now
is to sit here and wait
these spiders remain safely hidden day
and night
they only risk emerging for a split
second under the cover of darkness
to snatch their victim
oh here's a qriket look look a tree
cricket a very small one it's just
it's just beneath the lip
it's preening now it's it's just
millimeters from the edge of the lid and
it's it's stopped and it's preening its
antennae and leg
now the lid's moved just a fraction
so the spider is aware it's there
yes got it look at that did you see that
that was so quick this
is just one of the ingenious hunting
strategies spiders have evolved
one creature is determined not to miss
his chance
patagonia's male wandering tarantulas
are searching for love
this male spent four years reaching
maturity
but in two months you'll be dead
[Music]
you'll barely eat or sleep
this is what he's looking for
silken threads left by a female
impregnated with her pheromones
chemical love letters advertising her
availability
they lead him to her lair
she can live for 30 years she's seen
many suitors in the past
he taps a seductive rhythm to tempt her
out
she replies
for him this is a very dangerous liaison
he eyes her up
[Music]
if he's not her type she'll eat him
[Music]
but this male has a talent for seduction
he tendedly strokes her body
she relaxes opening her fangs
allowing him to move closer
he carefully delivers his packet of
sperm
during mating the female falls into a
trance-like state
[Music]
she stays like this for several minutes
he has to make a quick getaway before it
wears off
for tarantulas lingering goodbyes
are generally fatal
it's called darwin's bark spider and the
female
has a remarkable strategy
[Music]
like a real-life spider woman she sprays
strands of silk
in one long continuous flow
the threads fan out like a sail and
drift on air currents blowing across the
water
every few seconds she crimps the strands
together to stop them spreading too
widely
the breeze will do the rest blowing the
threads into a single line
and a 25 meter bridge
now she must reinforce her bridge
because her web will hang from it
[Music]
but there's something bouncing the line
at the other end
another darwin spider is trying to take
advantage of her hard work
[Music]
she must deal with the intruder head on
[Music]
the cut line is an inconvenience but no
more than that
with hooks on the tips of each leg she
gathers in the thread
[Music]
it won't go to waste as she'll eat it
[Music]
later
[Music]
when it's all reeled in she sprays again
[Music]
out streams another 25 meter
bridging line
[Music]
how a spider no bigger than a thumbnail
can produce so much silk
so quickly has baffled scientists
and it's no ordinary silk it's the
toughest natural fiber on the planet
tougher than steel
and it needs to be tough to span the
wide river
with the bridge taut and the ground
anchor in place
it's time to construct her trap
[Music]
latest orb webs up to two meters wide
[Music]
a few hours from the first spray of
bridging line
the job is done
now her strategy is simple
sit and wait
[Music]
and there's one final bout of silk
production
shrink-wrapping her food for later
[Music]
