When the air itself becomes saturated
and the temperature is just right...
rare giants emerge.
A powelliphanta snail.
It can grow to the size of a man's fist.
So rare,
they can only be filmed in captivity...
where their extraordinary behaviour
is revealed.
It's still a mystery as to exactly how
they track down their food.
But one thing is for sure.
This snail has unusual tastes.
And revolting table manners.
Its mouth envelops
and suffocates the earthworm.
It's sucked down like spaghetti.
For anything bigger, it's got 6,000 teeth,
ready to shred the next meal.
In this supersaturated environment,
this specialised snail
is the ultimate predator.
