Quan Quan is with his panda foster mum
at the moment,
but it's Ling Bing's turn
for some mummy me time.
At three months old,
the twins are swapped every five days.
The keepers distract her with bamboo
to separate her from Quang Quang.
While mum tucks into the green stuff,
the keepers remove the youngster.
It is essential the swap happens quickly
before foster mum notices baby is missing.
A bamboo distraction can only last
so long.
With Quan Quan delivered to the nursery,
the race is on to get his twin brother
Ling Bing to their panda foster mum
as quickly as possible.
Not many animals
would take their own babies back
after human intervention,
let alone someone else's.
Ground-breaking techniques
like a panda foster mum
are helping to save a species.
All that's left to do is slide
the door open.
She goes straight to Ling Bing
and starts grooming him.
As tender as a mother could be,
it's as if he's never been away.
