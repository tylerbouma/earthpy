under ceaseless attack the bait ball is
diminishing minute by minute the
relentless onslaught continues from
above with the swooping frigates
everywhere the hapless fish turn they're
torn to shreds the sardines may be more
maneuverable but an explosive bursts at
straight speed the sailfish has no equal
the bill slices side to side
disorientating the smaller fish leaving
them as isolated easy targets the
sardines will take any shelter on offer
even me
I'm in serious danger of getting
skewered once the bait balls diminished
the Sailfish won't stop til every last
fish is gone
