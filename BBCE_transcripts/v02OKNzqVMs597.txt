Title: Baby Leopard Plays with His Food | BBC Earth

One mother's loss is another's gain.
And she seems to have forgotten
about her son's earlier blunder.
It's just what he needs
to improve his handling skills.
He grabs the carcass and pounces on it
and rolls with it
and tries to kill it and claw it.
Living out his fantasy of what he wanted
to be when he grew up.
He's really quite a comical character
to watch.
Having seen his mother
take the carcass up the tree...
he really made an effort to do the same.
There's no shame in trying...
and at least he's got the right idea.
If he can stay out of trouble,
his enthusiastic spirit
should serve him well.
