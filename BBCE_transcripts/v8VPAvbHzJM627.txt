Title: Monitor Lizard Fights Mother Possum for Her Babies | BBC

The lace monitor is an agile tree-climber.
Its long claws allow it to grip
the smooth gum tree bark.
This particular tree has attracted
the attention of a lace monitor,
because it's the home of a female possum
with babies in her nest.
The possum's noisy defence
forces the monitor to retreat.
But hunger drives the lizard
to make a second attempt.
Lunging into the possum's nest
looks suicidal,
yet the monitor seems hardly
to notice the possum's bite.
It takes less than a minute
for the lizard to devour the baby possums
inside the nest.
