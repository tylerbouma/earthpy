The intimidation begins.
When neither backs down,
there can only be one outcome.
Fights can go on for hours
and can be to the death.
Forward-pointing tusks can stab
right through protective blubber.
This savage bite to the head
brings the contest to an end.
The incumbent has re-established
his right to mate with the females...
and he wastes no time.
This is a prime territory,
and he will face many more challenges
if he is to continue to hold it.
