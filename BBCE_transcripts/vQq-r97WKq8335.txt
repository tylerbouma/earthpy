[Applause]
now in the depths of winter she is
desperately hard to find
[Music]
the head of the family leads them to the
edge of their territory in search of
something to eat
[Music]
the only food here is wretchedly um
nourishing bark moss and lichen there's
hardly enough to sustain one monkey let
alone a family
but they share its peaceably
survival depends on the group keeping
together in these mountains any food is
precious a rival group
[Music]
they too are searching for food
[Music]
the two mayor's go head-to-head
and now the females join the fray
outnumbered the intruders retreat the
leader is the last to go
