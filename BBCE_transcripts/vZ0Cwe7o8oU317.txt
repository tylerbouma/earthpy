[Music]
over here and I'll show you to film
something has never been filmed
especially before which is one of
Australia's most common animals mating
[Music]
they found the echidnas they're doing
nothing so it's sort of irritating they
don't like the early mornings often
spend the first few hours the morning
was to do get up doing pretty much
nothing it's a slow process
[Music]
that's the end of that nutjob noodley
will have just strolled down the hill
gone straight back to sleep
[Music]
