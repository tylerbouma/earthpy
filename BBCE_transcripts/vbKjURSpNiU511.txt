to somewhere in a very very straight

fact that in those bushes she's got a
little surprise for us we're just gonna
keep back keep back keep back see what's
going on that's it she's going in
I could see her just ducked in the
bushes I can't see anything else maybe
she's just resting Oh

[Music]
she's got two tiny cups they are you
know more than a week old ears are still
folded almost flat they're blind very
wobbly they can hardly walk or move or
turn mouths are a religious gorgeous the
Cubs have tiny spots like a leopard
they'll fade as the Cubs get older but
they're great camouflage for the moment
are they are exquisite

well here we are in the season of
renewal and she Tippie as I now referred

[Music]
they are completely helpless 100%
dependent on her for everything from
milkis that's all they're getting they
really got teeth yet she's just totally
chilled totally relaxed which is lovely
[Music]
what amazing thing to find
[Music]
is made a beautiful illustration of just
how tender and attentive a massive root
of a predator like that can be
[Music]

looks to be secure
