there's plenty to eat
but getting to it can be a little
uncomfortable new water poses problems
for the youngsters but they know where
to find a dry seat
[Music]
a juicy snail is ample recompense for
sodden paws
[Music]
having survived the dry barren times
animals can now reap the rewards
on this seasonal planet the Great Plains
are lands of feast and famine at their
peak they support the greatest
gatherings of wildlife found anywhere on
earth
[Music]
