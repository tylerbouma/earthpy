Title: Tiger Cub's first Kill | David Attenborough | Tiger | Spy in the Jungle | BBC Earth

The cub is beginning to understand
his mother's changing demeanour.
Every posture has a special meaning.
When she has a target in her sights,
nothing will break her concentration.
She has taken her prey completely
by surprise.
She brings it down.
It's a sambar deer.
She partially throttles her victim,
but doesn't kill it.
She will use this one
to give a lesson to her cub.
The mother leaves him to get on with it,
but he is not quite sure what to do.
The throttle hold
is one of the most important things
he has to learn
and he's making a good start.
Giving half-killed prey to a cub like this
seems heartbreakingly cruel...
but learning to deal with live prey
is a vital step on the path
to becoming an independent hunter.
