In the summer of 2003,
a group of divers had an unnerving
encounter they'd never forget.
We were just at the beginning of
a weekend's diving in Ullapool.
It was at the beginning of July, I think,
and a hot, sunny day,
so we were keen to get in the water.
Because the sea was quite calm, we decided
that we'd head out to the Summer Isles,
because that's where
we all prefer to dive if we can.
There's a dive that we've done before,
Blackrock,
which we just thought we'd have
another dive on.
They dived for about 40 minutes
and photographed some
of the diverse marine life in the area.
It was a nice dive, we had a good time.
But they had no inkling of what
was about to happen next.
My wife and I finished our dive
and the other two guys
were getting kitted up
and the boat was just drifting along
and under no power.
and some distance behind the boat
we saw a shark fin.
At the time we thought
that it was a basking shark
and since the guys were already
in their diving gear,
they felt that they wanted to go
and have a dive with it, if they could.
As soon as I started the engine,
the shark turned
and instead of us approaching it,
it came rather aggressively
towards the boat.
I've seen basking sharks
several times before,
this was behaviour I'd never encountered,
such an aggressive turn and movement.
The shark approached
and swam alongside the boat,
very much giving us the once-over.
It swam alongside for about 15 seconds,
before slowly diving underneath
swimming away.
I'm a marine biologists professionally.
I spent a lot of time at sea and have seen
a large variety of different wildlife.
This was absolutely definitely
not a basking shark.
The colouration was totally different,
light grey on the surface with
very pale marking below the mid line.
There was also no sign
of the the large gill slits
that are very obvious in a basking shark.
I've never seen anything like this before.
A large pointed snout...
Small eyes to the side...
Large triangular fin.
And the size of the shark,
a good 5 metres.
I was convinced in my own mind
that this was a great white shark.
I could think of nothing else
that it could be.
