With the ariscos subdued, the gauchos make
the day long trek back to the main ranch,
where taming can begin.
From the wild herd,
they have chosen just three.
Today, the focus intensifies.
Vitito will face one arisco... alone.
Each gaucho has his own style of taming.
The mare has to decide
whether to trust Vitito.
He watches her ears, her nostrils.
Patiently, he works his magic.
In just three hours, this
mare has gone from wild to tame,
as she begins a new life with the gauchos.
