There's little doubt that silverback Ranu
would love to claim
his hard-earned right to the female
in his group.
But at 37 years old, Tuck is most
definitely not interested in sex.
Nearly all females stop
by their mid to late 30s.
Unfortunately, Ranu doesn't know this...
and keeps trying to impress her
with his displays of strength.
But all this seems to do is make Tuck
more determined to ignore him.
As Ranu continues to haunt Tuck,
her son's come to her defence.
Now the smallest gorilla in the group
decides to show the mighty silverback Ranu
who's in charge.
This is hardly
the great leader in control,
pushed around
by the youngest male in the group
and spurned by Tuck the only female.
Things couldn't get much worse.
