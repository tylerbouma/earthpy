With Mugaruka close on his tail,
Chimanuka keeps the family moving
and it becomes more and more difficult
to keep track of them.
I've given the rangers a camera
to make sure that we don't miss anything.
Having circled each other for some time,
Chimanuka and Mugaruka
are now metres apart.
This is a clear threat
to Chimanuka and his family.
It looks like Chimanuka
has seen off Mugaruka.
But at what cost?
The family have scattered.
Chimanuka has been injured.
And it'll be some time before
the full repercussions become apparent.
I won't see my gorilla family
for another couple of months.
Will Chimanuka be overthrown
and lose everything?
The fate of orphan Marhale, baby Mwira
and the whole family hangs in the balance.
