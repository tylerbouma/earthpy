Title: A Pride Of Lions Take Down An Elephant | Planet Earth | BBC Earth
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4nG4JsAyKY


Lions don't usually hunt elephants but
desperate times require desperate
measures
this herd contains cars easier targets
[Music]
but how to reach them
[Music]
the adults encircle their yard
it's an impenetrable wall of gray
[Music]
a few exhausted stragglers are still
arriving one of them is alone
[Music]
but it's too big for the monster
[Music]
this one looks a little smaller
[Music]
[Applause]
the solitary lion stands no chance but
the whole pride is here there are 30 of
them and their specialist elephant
hunters
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this elephant will feed the whole pride
for at least a week
[Music]
