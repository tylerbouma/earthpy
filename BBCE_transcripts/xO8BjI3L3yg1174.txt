This vast herd of Centrosaurus
are on the move...
from their nesting sites
on coastal lowlands to the east.
Unwittingly, they're moving towards
almost certain death.
Seasonal monsoons drive the Centrosaurs
inland, away from coastal flooding.
It's what the Daspletosaurus
have been waiting for.
Herding behaviour protects the many...
but at the expense of the few.
And things are about to get worse
for the Centrosaurs.
With a flooded river ahead...
and the Daspletosaurus behind...
the stage is now set for a massacre.
But despite the rich pickings,
it's not the Daspletosaurus
that are responsible
for the scale of the slaughter.
There's an even more deadly killer
at work here.
Severe monsoon rains have transformed
shallow rivers into lethal torrents.
The real killer is the weather itself.
