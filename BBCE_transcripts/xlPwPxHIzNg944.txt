Title: African Bullfrog Dad Protects Tadpoles | Battle of the Sexes in the Animal World | BBC Earth

These heavyweight amphibians
are African bullfrogs
and they breed explosively
when the heavy summer rains
create temporary pools.
Each male competes for a succession
of females and fertilizes their eggs.
He would accumulate several batches
of spawn, amounting to thousands of eggs.
When the exhausted females leave,
it's a powerful incentive for him to stay.
There's another good reason to:
Tadpoles need help to survive
the tropical sun
and its shrinking effect
on their shallow pools.
The father takes action
and shepherds his shoal
like a sheepdog herding a flock.
If the water gets too hot,
he herds his tadpoles
into cooler, deeper water
with a better supply of oxygen.
A hefty male also assumes
the role of guard dog.
The tadpoles are once again
heading for disaster.
Their nursery pools are temporary
and prone to dry up
in the heat of the withering sun.
This devoted parent is
not about to give up yet.
A lower land dweller himself,
he senses the need
to keep his offspring aquatic.
Using his strong back legs
and pointed snout,
the male digs a channel
to a neighboring puddle
to save his family.
This excavation work will flood
his own nursery
or act as an escape route.
In such circumstances,
a dutiful father is key to survival.
