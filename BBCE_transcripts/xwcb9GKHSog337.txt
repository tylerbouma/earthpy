darting is a necessary intrusion though
flip never takes it lightly and for him
getting this close to lions never loses
its magic beautiful the GPS collar is
the first time I touch it for nine
months it's been on this lioness this
whole time and it is still working the
LED light is still going you can see it
so it's been storing all this incredible
information for the last nine months

queen of them all I know this is my wife

edge okay well now we have to look at

citizen movements back and forth back to
Taurus G's writing for us three
passports
I spent

live right under people's noses without
causing them any trouble at all we now
