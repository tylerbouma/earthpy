it's as though he's stalking prey
pushing forward as silently and
stealthily as he can oh oh here comes
Tom if she's attacked in tunnel
go for it girl go for it girl
unbelievable that's telling him don't
Oh unbelievable I thought for sure he
was gonna come in and kill the Cubs what
a mom Tama is now that is what you call
defending your family well done girl and
straight to her family running back to
her kids what a girl
she's about two-thirds of his weight
that takes guts to fling yourself
straight into the face of an adult male
lion that takes guts
