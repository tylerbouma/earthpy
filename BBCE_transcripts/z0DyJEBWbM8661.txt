the letterbox are lovely magnificent
creatures they're large they're
overwhelming and they're gentle we've
seen our our Schools program and it's
aimed at the younger ones and from the
from the age of seven they will have had
the knowledge about the turtles and they
will continue the work I'm sure I see
the blaze in their eyes my name's Jake

this kind of stuff we want in the water

first time ever in life to see a
leatherback turtle I wasn't expecting it
to be that big it's like bigger than me
and you there are the ones who have to
continue the work we are doing right now
and this is where Dominica is really
releasing its hope for the complete
protection of the species on this planet
anytime I see a plastic or a bottle in
the sea I like take it up pick it up and
threw it in the bin or if I see someone
