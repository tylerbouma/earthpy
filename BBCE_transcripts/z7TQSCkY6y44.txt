[Music]
and this bobcat
may be in luck for this particular
valley
is blessed
a river here never freezes
it's fed by a volcanic hot spring that
heats these waters to 50 degrees warmer
than the surrounding air
hungry animals of all kinds come here to
feed
[Music]
throughout the winter the river is full
of food
for those who know how to catch it
here even the coyotes have become
fishermen
but hunting is hard for a cat that's not
used to getting its feet wet
so he must choose his target with care
[Music]
golden eye ducks but can he get close
enough to pounce
great
perhaps you'll have more luck on the
other side
here steam from the river warms the
surrounding trees
so up in the branches there could be
prey
if only he could get to it
it's six meters up
at last a squirrel
not much but enough to keep him going
to survive a winter in these mountains
takes
tenacity and bobcats have that
in abundance
[Music]
