You are beautiful look at you.
Scruff, Scruff.
He is my favourite wolf.
He is so bold.
Incredibly curious.
I suppose that's just part of being
a wolf that's just over one year old.
No...
Breaking the camera shot.
No.
Every day that goes by I'm feeling more
and more comfortable with my wolves.
I want to see if I can build
a whole new level of trust.
It's great that Banjo is so confident.
But maybe I've taken this too far.
I just have to hold my nerve.
Scruffy.
I don't like you going behind me,
you know that.
You are still a wolf.
Is that my scent you're getting.
Rather him than me.
I haven't washed in weeks.
I think I can see how
this fearsome predator
eventually became man's best friend.
Hey, Scruffy.
Don't even think about it.
Look at the size of you.
He's actually quite nervous.
He's flinching at the slightest sound
I make.
I think I might be getting over
my slight fear of Scruffy.
I think he's just incredibly inquisitive.
He just wants to have a good old look.
I think I am understanding him more
than I did.
He's still an enormous wolf,
but he just wants to get as close to me
as I want to get him really.
I suppose that's how it's working.
