Title: Hungry Polar Bear Ambushes Seal | The Hunt | BBC Earth

At this time of year,
polar bears, on average,
succeed only once in 20 hunts.
If the hunter is skinny, like this one,
that may not be often enough.
All she can do is keep trying.
To prevent her scent betraying her,
she makes a wide sweep
to get downwind of the seal.
Getting close.
She's now right behind the seal.
Incredibly,
she caught the seal underwater.
It's only small, but even so,
its blubber alone
will contain 100,000 calories,
enough to sustain this bear for a week.
And, in that time,
she might even catch another.
But this can't go on forever.
As summer continues,
temperatures are rising.
Each hunt requires more energy...
draining the bears of their reserves.
